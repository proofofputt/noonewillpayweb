## üìñ Origin Story

### Bitcoin Pizza Day

**May 22, 2010:**
- Laszlo Hanyecz bought 2 pizzas for 10,000 BTC
- First real-world Bitcoin transaction
- Proved Bitcoin could be currency
- Now celebrated annually

**Pizza Ninjas Connection:**
- Honors this historic moment
- Ninjas = stealthy, like early Bitcoiners
- Pizza = community, sharing, adoption
- Blend of serious tech + fun culture

### Project Launch

**Early 2023:**
- Ordinals ecosystem emerging
- Need for strong communities
- PFP culture from Ethereum
- Bitcoin-native identity needed

**Pizza Ninjas Solution:**
- Bitcoin-first values
- Technical innovation (recursive)
- Strong visual identity
- Community over hype

## üé® Collection Design

### Recursive Technology

**Innovation:**
Pizza Ninjas pioneered recursive inscriptions:

**How it Works:**
```

2. Each ninja references library
3. Saves space + costs
4. Enables complex rendering
5. All still on-chain
```

**Benefits:**
- 90% smaller file sizes
- Lower inscription costs
- Consistent rendering
- Upgradeable visuals (controversial but possible)

**Example Structure:**
```html
<!-- Ninja #5432 inscription -->
<script src="/content/[library-id]"></script>
<script>
  renderNinja({
    background: "blue",
    skin: "light",
