## 🔐 Before You Begin: Understanding Seed Phrases

### The Beautiful Math of Bitcoin Security

**Did you know?**

There are more possible Bitcoin seed phrase combinations than there are **atoms in the observable universe**.

```
Number of 12-word seed phrases: ~2^128 (340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000)
Number of atoms in universe:     ~10^82 (100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000)
```

**What this means for you:**

✅ You can **learn by doing** - create a practice wallet right now
✅ The odds of someone guessing your seed phrase = **effectively zero**
✅ Start simple, upgrade later (multi-sig, multi-device, multi-institutional)
✅ No need to be perfect on day one - just get started!

This chapter uses a **"hot wallet"** (on your phone/computer) which is perfect for:
- Learning how Bitcoin works
- Receiving small amounts
- Participating in the Pizza Ninjas network
- Getting your first treasury rewards

Later, you'll learn about cold storage, hardware wallets, and multi-signature setups for securing larger amounts.

**For now: Let's get you set up in 10 minutes!**

## 📱 Step 1: Download Xverse Wallet

### What is Xverse?

Xverse is a **self-custody Bitcoin wallet** that supports:
- ✅ **Taproot addresses** (bc1p... - latest Bitcoin technology)
- ✅ **Ordinals & Runes** (Bitcoin digital artifacts)
- ✅ **Lightning Network** (instant, low-fee payments)
- ✅ **Stacks** (Bitcoin smart contracts)
- ✅ Clean, beginner-friendly interface

**"Self-custody" means YOU control your Bitcoin** - no exchange, no bank, no intermediary.

### Download Links

**Mobile (Recommended for Beginners):**
- 🍎 **iOS**: [App Store - Search "Xverse Wallet"](https://apps.apple.com/app/xverse-wallet/id1552418469)
- 🤖 **Android**: [Google Play - Search "Xverse Wallet"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.secretkeylabs.xverse)

**Browser Extension:**
- 🌐 **Chrome**: [Chrome Web Store - Xverse Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore)
- 🦊 **Firefox**: [Firefox Add-ons - Xverse Wallet](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)

**👉 Choose ONE device for now** (you can add more later)

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Create Your Wallet

### 2a. Open Xverse and Click "Create New Wallet"

1. Open the Xverse app
2. You'll see two options:
   - **"Create New Wallet"** ← Choose this
   - "Restore Wallet" (for existing seed phrases)

### 2b. Set a Strong Password

Your password protects access to the app (but NOT your Bitcoin - that's the seed phrase!).

**Password Requirements:**
- At least 12 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Don't reuse passwords from other sites

**Examples:**
- ✅ Good: `Pizza!Ninjas@2025-Austin`
- ❌ Bad: `password123`

**Pro Tip:** Use a password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)

### 2c. Your Wallet is Created!

Xverse will show a screen like:
```
🎉 Wallet Created!

Your seed phrase will be displayed next.
This is the MOST IMPORTANT STEP.
```

**Click "Continue" when ready.**

---

## 🔑 Step 3: Backup Your Seed Phrase

### What You'll See: 12 Secret Words

Xverse will display **12 random words** like this:

```
1. pizza      5. ninja      9. orange
2. freedom    6. wallet    10. payment
3. bitcoin    7. secure    11. network
4. satoshi    8. backup    12. cryptic
```

☝️ **These are NOT your actual words - yours will be different!**

### Critical Rules for Seed Phrase Security

#### ✅ DO THIS:
1. **Write on paper** using pen (not pencil - can fade)
2. **Double-check spelling** - every letter matters
3. **Verify word order** - 1-12 sequence is critical
4. **Store in a safe place**:
   - Home safe
   - Safety deposit box
   - Hidden drawer (not obvious location)
5. **Make 2-3 copies** in different locations

#### ❌ NEVER DO THIS:
- ❌ Take a screenshot
- ❌ Save in phone notes
- ❌ Email to yourself
- ❌ Store in cloud (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox)
- ❌ Take a photo
- ❌ Share with ANYONE (not even "support")

### Why This Matters

**These 12 words ARE your Bitcoin.**

- ✅ With them = you control your Bitcoin forever
- ❌ Without them = your Bitcoin is GONE if phone breaks/lost
- 🚨 Someone else gets them = they steal your Bitcoin

**No bank. No password reset. No customer support can help if you lose these words.**

### Advanced Security (Optional - For Later)

When you're ready to secure larger amounts:
- Metal seed phrase backup (fireproof, waterproof)
- BIP39 passphrase (25th word)
- Multi-signature wallets (2-of-3, 3-of-5)
- Geographic distribution (different cities/countries)

**For now:** Paper in a safe place is fine for learning!

---

## ✍️ Step 4: Verify Your Seed Phrase

Xverse will test you to make sure you wrote it down correctly.

### What Xverse Will Ask:

```
Enter word #3: ________
Enter word #7: ________
Enter word #12: ________
```

### How to Verify:

1. Look at your paper backup
2. Find the word numbers Xverse is asking for
3. Type them **exactly** as shown (lowercase)
4. Click "Confirm"

### If You Made a Mistake:

- Click "Back"
- Review your seed phrase again
- Correct any errors on your paper
- Try verification again

**Only proceed when 100% certain!**

---

## 📍 Step 5: Get Your Taproot Address

```

**This is your Taproot address!**

## 🔒 Security Reminders

### Keep Your Seed Phrase Safe

**These 12 words = your Bitcoin**

- 📝 Written on paper, stored securely
- 🏠 Multiple secure locations (home safe, safety deposit box)
- 🚫 NEVER digital (no photos, no cloud, no notes app)
- 🤐 NEVER shared (no one legitimate will ever ask)

### Watch Out for Scams

**Common Bitcoin scams:**

❌ **"Support" asking for seed phrase** - SCAM (we NEVER ask)
❌ **"Send 1 BTC, get 2 back"** - SCAM (no one gives free Bitcoin)
❌ **"Update your wallet" phishing emails** - SCAM (verify URLs)
❌ **Fake Xverse apps** - Only download from official stores

**Golden rule: If it sounds too good to be true, it is.**

### Best Practices

1. **Start small** - practice with $10-50 before storing large amounts
2. **Verify addresses** - Bitcoin transactions are IRREVERSIBLE
3. **Use strong password** - protects app access
4. **Enable biometrics** - Face ID / fingerprint (convenient + secure)
5. **Upgrade later** - hardware wallet when you're ready for serious amounts

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: What if I lose my seed phrase?

**A:** Your Bitcoin is **permanently lost**. There is no "password reset" for Bitcoin. This is why backing up your seed phrase is so critical.

### Q: What if someone finds my seed phrase?

**A:** They can **steal all your Bitcoin**. Treat your seed phrase like cash - keep it hidden and secure.

### Q: Can I change my seed phrase?

**A:** No. Each seed phrase generates a unique wallet. To "change" it, you'd create a new wallet (new seed phrase) and transfer your Bitcoin to the new addresses.

### Q: What's the difference between password and seed phrase?

**A:**
- **Password** = Unlocks the Xverse app (protects your phone/computer)
- **Seed Phrase** = Your actual Bitcoin (can recover wallet on any device)

You can reset the app password. You cannot reset the seed phrase.

### Q: Why Taproot instead of other address types?

**A:**
- **Lowest transaction fees** (cheaper to send Bitcoin)
- **Best privacy** (all transactions look similar)
- **Ordinals/Runes support** (digital artifacts on Bitcoin)
- **Latest Bitcoin tech** (upgraded in 2021)

### Q: Is it safe to give out my Taproot address?

**A:** Yes! Your Bitcoin address is public (like an email address). Share it freely to **receive** Bitcoin. Just never share your seed phrase or private keys.

### Q: What if I entered the wrong Taproot address in my profile?

**A:** Edit your profile and update it. Make sure you copy it correctly from Xverse. If you entered a wrong address, any Bitcoin sent there is lost (that's why we start with small test amounts!).
