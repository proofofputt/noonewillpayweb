# Chapter 14: Nostr & Decentralized Social Networks

**Progress: 95-100/100**

## Introduction

Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a simple, open protocol for censorship-resistant social networking. Built by Bitcoin developers and embraced by the Bitcoin community, Nostr represents the social layer of the decentralized internet.

## üåê What is Nostr?

**Nostr** is:
- A protocol (not a platform)
- Decentralized (no company owns it)
- Censorship-resistant (can't be shut down)
- Portable (own your identity and data)
- Bitcoin-native (Lightning integration)

**Key Insight:**
Nostr isn't Twitter. It's a protocol that enables many Twitter-like (and other) applications to be built on top of it.

## üîë Core Concepts

### Public/Private Keys

**Your Identity:**
- **Private Key (nsec):** Your password, never share
- **Public Key (npub):** Your username, share freely

```
Private Key (nsec): nsec1abc123... (keep secret!)
Public Key (npub): npub1xyz789... (your identity)
```

**This Means:**
- You own your identity (not a company)
- Can't be banned (no central authority)
- One identity across all Nostr apps
- Portable data (take it anywhere)

### Relays

**What are relays?**
- Servers that store and transmit notes
- Anyone can run one
- Clients connect to multiple relays
- No single point of failure

**How it works:**
```
1. You write a note
2. Sign with your private key
3. Send to connected relays
4. Relays broadcast to subscribers
5. Your followers receive from their relays
```

**Relay Examples:**
- relay.damus.io (popular)
- nostr.mom (community relay)
- relay.nostr.band (aggregator)
- Your own relay (self-hosted)

### Events (Notes)

**Everything is an event:**
- Kind 0: Metadata (profile info)
- Kind 1: Short text note (like tweet)
- Kind 3: Contact list (follows)
- Kind 4: Encrypted DMs
- Kind 7: Reactions (likes)
- Kind 40-42: Chat rooms
- And many more...

**Event Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "abc123...",
  "pubkey": "npub1xyz...",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [],
  "content": "Hello Nostr!",
  "sig": "signature..."
}
```

## ‚ö° Lightning Integration (Zaps)

### What are Zaps?

**Zaps** are Lightning payments on Nostr:
- Instant Bitcoin tips
- Attached to notes
- Show appreciation
- Support creators

**How it Works:**
```
1. You like someone's note
2. Click "‚ö° Zap"
3. Choose amount (e.g., 100 sats)
4. Lightning invoice generated
5. Your wallet pays
6. Zap shows publicly on note
```

### Setting Up Zaps

**Requirements:**
- Lightning wallet (Wallet of Satoshi, Alby, Strike)
- Lightning address (you@yourdomain.com or lnurl)
- Add to Nostr profile

**Configure:**
1. Get Lightning address from wallet
2. Add to Nostr profile metadata
3. Verify it's working (zap yourself)
4. Start zapping others!

**Popular Amounts:**
- 21 sats (Bitcoin number)
- 100 sats (casual tip)
- 1,000 sats (quality content)
- 10,000+ sats (exceptional)

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Encrypted DMs

**Private Messaging:**
- End-to-end encrypted
- Only you and recipient can read
- Uses Nostr keys for encryption

**Limitations:**
- Metadata visible (who, when)

- #dmv (local community)

### Web of Trust

**Reputation System:**
- Follow people you trust
- See their follows
- Filter spam/bots
- Build trust network

**How to Use:**
1. Follow trusted people
2. Review their follows
3. Set trust levels
4. Filter unknown accounts

### Badges & Verification

**NIP-05 Verification:**
- Links npub to domain
- Shows you control domain

**Setup:**
```
1. Add JSON file to your domain:
   yourdomain.com/.well-known/nostr.json

2. File contents:
   {
     "names": {
       "yourname": "your_npub_hex"
     }
   }

3. Add to Nostr profile:
