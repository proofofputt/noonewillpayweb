## Question 1: The Debt-to-Growth Ratio

**Question:** According to Booth, what is the approximate ratio of global debt to global growth, and what does this reveal about our economic system?

**A)** $50 trillion debt for $185 trillion growth—showing healthy economic expansion
**B)** $185 trillion debt for $46 trillion growth—revealing unsustainable 4:1 ratio
**C)** $46 trillion debt for $185 trillion growth—demonstrating sound economic policy
**D)** $100 trillion debt for $100 trillion growth—indicating balanced economic system

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Booth reveals the brutal math: "It has taken approximately $185 trillion of global debt to achieve $46 trillion of global growth." This 4-to-1 ratio shows we're not experiencing real growth but a debt-fueled spending binge that must eventually collapse. This is the foundation of his argument that our system is fundamentally unsustainable.

## Question 2: Information Economics

**Question:** What does Booth mean when he says information-based technology creates job displacement that's different from previous industrial revolutions?

**A)** Information technology creates more jobs than it destroys
**B)** Information doesn't have physical constraints and travels seamlessly across borders, eradi cating waste that includes our jobs
**C)** Information technology requires more education, creating university employment
**D)** Information work can't be automated like physical labor

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Booth explains: "Information doesn't have the same constraints that physical goods have: it travels seamlessly across borders. It is much more efficient, eradicating a lot of waste from the system. But much of that waste and inefficiency are our jobs." This is why "new jobs will be created" may not hold true this time—information-based automation eliminates entire categories of work permanently.

## Question 3: Technology's Exponential Deflation

**Question:** Beyond Moore's Law, what annual decline in price-to-performance should we expect from computing technology according to Booth?

**A)** 10 percent annual decline
**B)** 25 percent annual decline
**C)** 40 percent annual decline
**D)** 60 percent annual decline

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Booth states: "Beyond just the doubling of computing power, we should expect a 40 percent annual decline in price to performance." This exponential deflation means technology's downward pressure on prices will eventually overwhelm any attempt to create inflation through money printing—the deflationary force is simply too great to stop.

## Question 4: Currency Devaluation Strategy

**Question:** According to Booth, why do countries competitively devalue their currencies, and why does this strategy ultimately fail?

**A)** Devaluation attracts foreign investment and creates permanent job growth
**B)** Devaluation lowers labor costs temporarily but asset prices rise faster than jobs can be created
**C)** Devaluation strengthens exports and leads to sustained economic prosperity
**D)** Devaluation reduces government debt and improves fiscal stability

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Booth explains that "a country that devalues its currency also indirectly lowers its labour rate against global competitors, which can help some job growth in the short term." However, "the endless game of reducing the value of currencies only serves as a short-term panacea, because asset prices will rise far more quickly than jobs can be created." This is the trap of competitive devaluation—temporary relief followed by worse problems.

## Question 5: Debt Combined with Deflation

**Question:** Why does Booth describe "debt combined with deflation" as a "toxic combination"?

**A)** Banks refuse to lend money during deflationary periods
**B)** Borrowers must pay the same debt amount while their earning power decreases
**C)** Deflation causes interest rates to rise automatically
**D)** Technology companies go bankrupt during deflationary cycles

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Booth explains: "Debt combined deflation is a toxic combination, because borrowers have to pay the same for their interest payments while earning less." As deflation naturally occurs from technology, the real burden of existing debt grows heavier even though the nominal amount stays constant. This creates a debt trap that becomes impossible to escape without default or hyperinflation.

## Question 6: Bitcoin's Fixed Supply

**Question:** According to Booth, how does Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins relate to solving the technology-money conflict?

**A)** Fixed supply prevents inflation, allowing technology's deflation to create abundance
**B)** Fixed supply makes Bitcoin valuable as a speculative investment asset
**C)** Fixed supply attracts institutional investors seeking portfolio diversification
**D)** Fixed supply simplifies accounting for businesses using Bitcoin

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:** Booth argues that "Bitcoin attempts to change that dynamic by forever fixing supply at twenty one million Bitcoins." This scarcity in money enables abundance in goods—we need money that cannot be inflated to preserve value while technology makes everything cheaper. Bitcoin provides the sound money foundation that allows deflation to be celebrated as abundance rather than fought as a threat.

## Question 7: The Solar Energy Revolution

**Question:** What does Booth identify as the significance of levelized cost of utility-grade solar dropping 88 percent in ten years?

**A)** Solar provides clean energy that reduces carbon emissions
**B)** Cheap energy makes everything else cheaper since energy underlies all production
**C)** Solar creates manufacturing jobs in panel production
**D)** Solar independence reduces geopolitical energy conflicts

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Booth notes that "Levelized cost of utility-grade solar dropped 88 percent in the last ten years" and emphasizes that energy is foundational to all economic activity. When energy becomes cheap, it should make everything cheaper—manufacturing, transportation, food production, water purification. This deflationary abundance should make everyone richer, but our inflationary monetary system prevents this prosperity from reaching people.
