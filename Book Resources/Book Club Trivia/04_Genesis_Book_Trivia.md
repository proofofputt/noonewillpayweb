## Question 1: Hayek's Strategy for Sound Money

**Question:** In his famous 1984 quote opening The Genesis Book, what strategy did Friedrich Hayek propose for reintroducing sound money?

**A)** Elect politicians who support gold standard restoration
**B)** Introduce something "by some sly roundabout way" that governments can't stop
**C)** Organize international economic sanctions against fiat currencies
**D)** Create a new central bank with strict constitutional limits

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Hayek stated: "Since we can't take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is, by some sly, roundabout way, introduce something they can't stop." This became Bitcoin's strategic blueprint—not seeking permission or fighting governments directly, but creating an alternative system that operates outside government control. The "sly roundabout way" is building code, not lobbying legislators.

## Question 2: Currency Wars and Political Consequences

**Question:** According to van Wirdum, what political consequence resulted from the currency devaluations and economic depression of the 1920s-1930s?

**A)** International cooperation on monetary policy through Bretton Woods
**B)** Widespread return to gold standard for stability
**C)** Fertile ground for violent nationalist, racist, and authoritarian ideologies
**D)** Democratic reforms strengthening central bank independence

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The book explains: "Series of currency devaluations, combined with a deep economic depression, was taking its toll-especially in the countries that had lost the war. Destroyed savings, widespread unemployment, and a lack of prospects in large parts of Europe represented a source of uncertainty, despair and, ultimately, anger. Fertile feeding ground for a new and particularly violent, nationalist, racist, and authoritarian collectivist ideology." This demonstrates why sound money matters for peace and democracy.

## Question 3: Chaum's Panopticon Warning

**Question:** What did David Chaum mean by describing cyberspace with identification as a "panopticon nightmare"?

**A)** Hackers could steal identities and commit fraud easily
**B)** Everything you do could be known to anyone and recorded forever
**C)** Government surveillance would become technologically obsolete
**D)** Digital identities would be too complex for ordinary people to manage

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Chaum warned: "Cyberspace doesn't have all the physical constraints. There are no walls... it's a different, scary, weird place, and with identification it's a panopticon nightmare. Right? Everything you do could be known to anyone else, could be recorded forever. It's antithetical to the basic principle underlying the mechanisms of democracy." This understanding of surveillance's threat to democracy drove the Cypherpunk movement's focus on privacy tools.

## Question 4: Adam Back's Electronic Cash Requirements

**Question:** Which of the following was NOT one of Adam Back's six essential properties for electronic cash?

**A)** Anonymous (privacy preserving)
**B)** Distributed (hard to shut down)
**C)** Government approved (legally sanctioned)
**D)** Require no trust of any individual

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Adam Back's list specified: "1. Anonymous (privacy preserving), 2. Distributed (to make it hard to shut down), 3. Have some built in scarcity, 4. Require no trust of any one individual, 5. Preferably offline, 6. Reusable." Notably absent is any requirement for government approval—Cypherpunks deliberately designed systems to work WITHOUT seeking permission from authorities. This blueprint directly informed Bitcoin's design.

## Question 5: Nick Szabo on Trusted Third Parties

**Question:** Complete Nick Szabo's famous principle: "Trusted third parties are..."

**A)** "...necessary evils that should be minimized"
**B)** "...security holes that should be eliminated by protocol design"
**C)** "...convenient but expensive intermediaries"
**D)** "...inevitable in any practical payment system"

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Szabo stated: "Trusted third parties are security holes. The best 'TTP' of all is one that does not exist, but the necessity for which has been eliminated by the protocol design, or which has been automated and distributed amongst the parties to a protocol." This principle is fundamental to Bitcoin's architecture—eliminating trust requirements entirely through cryptography and distributed consensus.

## Question 6: Hashcash and Digital Scarcity

**Question:** According to van Wirdum, what was Hashcash's key innovation that later enabled Bitcoin?

**A)** Creating digital signatures that couldn't be forged
**B)** Tying purely digital data to real physical resources (energy)
**C)** Encrypting messages so only recipients could read them
**D)** Allowing peer-to-peer file sharing without servers

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The book explains: "Hashcash's key innovation was that it tied purely digital data (numbers, essentially) to real resources in physical reality. Producing proof of work required computing cycles, and computing cycles themselves use up electricity, which in turn costs energy to produce. Fundamental scarcity of energy in physical reality into the digital realm." This breakthrough made digital scarcity possible for the first time, solving the problem of costless copying.

## Question 7: The Cypherpunk Manifesto

**Question:** According to Eric Hughes in "A Cypherpunk's Manifesto," what is the Cypherpunk response to the need for privacy protection?

**A)** Cypherpunks lobby governments for privacy legislation
**B)** Cypherpunks write academic papers about privacy theory
**C)** Cypherpunks write code to defend privacy
**D)** Cypherpunks educate the public about privacy risks

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Hughes declared: "Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and we're going to write it." This action-oriented ethos—building tools rather than seeking permission—defined the movement and led directly to Bitcoin. Rather than lobbying for better laws, Cypherpunks created cryptographic systems that made privacy possible through mathematics.
