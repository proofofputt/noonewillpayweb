**Answer:** 21
**Explanation:** Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist due to the halving schedule and fixed supply cap.
**Pill Sign:** Orange
**Why This Matters:** Most people don't understand fixed supply vs. infinite fiat money printing. This is the foundation of monetary scarcity.

#### 2. btc_fund_03 (Hard - 20 points)
**Question:** In what year was the Bitcoin Genesis Block mined?
**Hint:** This was during the financial crisis, embedded in the coinbase message
**Answer:** 2009
**Explanation:** January 3, 2009. Satoshi embedded 'The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks' in the genesis block.
**Pill Sign:** Green
**Why This Matters:** Bitcoin wasn't created in a vacuum - it was a direct response to 2008 financial crisis bailouts. Context matters.

#### 3. btc_fund_04 (Easy - 10 points)
**Question:** How many Bitcoin halvings have occurred as of 2025?
**Hint:** Last one was in 2024
**Answer:** 4
**Explanation:** Halvings occurred in 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024. The next will be around 2028.
**Pill Sign:** Orange
**Why This Matters:** Halvings control inflation rate - understanding this mechanism is crucial to understanding Bitcoin's programmatic scarcity.

#### 4. mining_01 (Easy - 10 points)
**Question:** What percentage (approximately) of Bitcoin mining uses renewable energy?
**Hint:** More than half - Bitcoin miners chase cheap energy
**Answer:** 55 (tolerance: +/- 10)
**Explanation:** Studies estimate 50-60% of Bitcoin mining uses renewable energy, as miners seek the cheapest power sources globally.
**Pill Sign:** Orange
**Why This Matters:** Media narrative says "Bitcoin wastes energy" but most people don't know 55%+ is renewable. This destroys the FUD.

#### 5. monetary_01 (Easy - 10 points)
**Question:** In what year did President Nixon end the Gold Standard?
**Hint:** Early 1970s - a pivotal moment in monetary history
**Answer:** 1971
**Explanation:** On August 15, 1971, Nixon closed the gold window, ending Bretton Woods and ushering in the pure fiat era.
**Pill Sign:** Green
**Why This Matters:** Most Americans have no idea money was backed by gold within living memory. 1971 is THE pivotal year they don't teach in school.

#### 6. monetary_07 (Medium - 15 points)
**Question:** What is the annual inflation target for the Federal Reserve (in percent)?
**Hint:** It's a small single-digit number
**Answer:** 2
**Explanation:** The Fed targets 2% annual inflation, meaning your money loses purchasing power by design. Bitcoin has zero inflation after all are mined.
**Pill Sign:** Orange
**Why This Matters:** People don't realize 2% inflation = guaranteed wealth erosion by design. It's not "price stability," it's theft.

#### 7. monetary_02 (Medium - 15 points)
**Question:** Approximately how many fiat currencies exist in the world today?
**Hint:** It's one of the orange pill numbers - think about UN member states
**Answer:** 180 (tolerance: +/- 20)
**Explanation:** There are approximately 180 fiat currencies globally, all subject to inflation and government control. Bitcoin is one.
**Pill Sign:** Orange
**Why This Matters:** 180 failing currencies vs. one Bitcoin. People don't grasp the scale of monetary fragmentation and failure.

#### 8. economic_03 (Hard - 20 points)
**Question:** What was the approximate U.S. inflation rate (CPI) peak in 2022 (in percent)?
**Hint:** It was the highest in 40 years - a single digit
**Answer:** 9 (tolerance: +/- 1)
**Explanation:** U.S. inflation peaked around 9% in mid-2022, the highest since the early 1980s, driving Bitcoin interest as a hedge.
**Pill Sign:** Orange
**Why This Matters:** Recent history already memory-holed. People experienced 9% inflation two years ago and already forgot.

## Rationale for Selection

### The Knowledge Gap Philosophy

**Critical Insight:** This survey doesn't test obscure trivia or common knowledge - it reveals and corrects systematic knowledge gaps that keep people financially and energetically disempowered.

**What People SHOULD Know But Don't:**

1. **Monetary Fundamentals Everyone Lacks:**
   - Most Americans don't know money was backed by gold until 1971 (within living memory!)
   - People don't understand Fed's 2% inflation target = designed wealth erosion
   - "Bitcoin is too expensive" reveals ignorance of satoshis (100M per BTC)
   - Recent 9% inflation (2022) already memory-holed by most adults
   - 180 fiat currencies all failing simultaneously vs. one Bitcoin

2. **Energy/Utility Ignorance:**
   - **SHOCKING:** Most homeowners have NO idea what they pay per kWh for electricity
   - Can't evaluate solar ROI without knowing electricity costs (15¢/kWh DMV)
   - SRECs = free money from solar panels most people don't know exists (1,000 kWh = 1 SREC)
   - Don't know their own monthly electric bill (~$125 average)
   - No clue about appliance consumption (refrigerator ~150W)
   - Local residents unaware of Clean Energy DC 2032 mandate affecting their future

3. **Bitcoin Truths Countering Media Narratives:**
   - Media: "Bitcoin wastes energy" / Reality: 55%+ renewable (most don't know this)
   - 21M fixed supply vs. infinite fiat (fundamental concept missed by many)
   - 2009 genesis block context (financial crisis response, not random)
   - Halvings control inflation (programmable scarcity vs. central bank whims)

4. **Digital Literacy for Safety:**
   - HTTPS port 443 awareness = security consciousness for wallet safety
   - HTTP 404 / port 80 / IPv4 bits = baseline internet understanding
   - Facebook 2004 timeline reveals centralization trajectory Bitcoin resists

### Via Negativa: What We REMOVED

This curation ruthlessly cut questions that were:
- **Actually well-known:** Water boiling point (212°F), days in year (365), body temperature (98.6°F)
- **Genuinely obscure:** Perfect numbers, Plato's city population, gunpowder invention year
- **Pure entertainment:** Pokemon count, Dragon Ball Z memes, Hitchhiker's Guide references
- **Too variable:** Milk prices, SREC dollar values (kept SREC concept via kWh requirement)
- **Political distractions:** Minimum wage debates

### Educational Architecture

**Balance (21 total):**
- Bitcoin/Monetary: 8 questions (fundamental monetary literacy)
- Utilities/Economics: 8 questions (practical energy knowledge gaps)
- Technology: 5 questions (digital security/literacy)

**Difficulty Distribution:**
- Easy (10 pts): 8 questions - confidence building, baseline knowledge
- Medium (15 pts): 7 questions - reward engaged learners
- Hard (20 pts): 6 questions - challenge even informed participants

**Pill Sign Balance:**
- Orange: 11 questions
- Green: 10 questions

### Practical Utility Focus

Every question serves one of three purposes:

1. **Actionable Economic Knowledge:**
   - Know your kWh cost → can evaluate solar/mining ROI
   - Know SRECs exist → can monetize solar beyond savings
   - Know Clean Energy DC 2032 → understand regulatory trajectory
   - Know electricity bill baseline → identify inefficiencies

2. **Monetary Truth Revelation:**
   - 1971 = fiat experiment within living memory
   - 2% inflation = theft by design
   - 21M supply = real scarcity vs. infinite fiat
   - 55% renewable = destroys "Bitcoin wastes energy" FUD

3. **Digital Security Literacy:**
   - Port 443 = HTTPS = safety for wallet interactions
   - IPv4 scarcity = understanding digital resource limits
   - HTTP basics = navigating Bitcoin's internet-native environment

### Regional Relevance

DMV-specific questions ground global Bitcoin in local context:
- **Economic_01:** DMV electricity costs (15¢/kWh) - your actual cost
- **Mining_03:** Clean Energy DC 2032 - your city's legislated energy future
- **Monetary_04:** 270 electoral votes - local political power + project symbolism

This transforms Bitcoin from abstract to actionable: affects your bill, your vote, your energy future.

## Selection Philosophy Summary

**The Mission:** Expose and correct knowledge gaps that keep people financially and energetically disempowered.

**What This Survey Reveals:**
- You probably don't know your electricity cost per kWh (most people don't)
- You probably don't know what 1971 means for money (they don't teach this in school)
- You probably don't know Bitcoin runs on 55%+ renewable energy (media hides this)
- You probably don't know SRECs exist (free money you're missing)
- You probably don't know the Fed targets 2% inflation (designed theft)

**What This Survey Corrects:**
By answering these 21 questions, participants gain:
1. Monetary literacy (1971, inflation targets, fixed supply)
2. Energy economics literacy (kWh costs, SRECs, consumption baselines)
3. Bitcoin truth (renewable %, halvings, satoshis)
4. Digital security awareness (HTTPS, port knowledge)

**The Philosophy:**
This isn't trivia for entertainment. This is education through revelation - showing people what they SHOULD know but don't, then teaching them. The gaps are systematic, not random. The corrections are empowering, not merely informative.

**Via Negativa Applied:**
Success through removal. Cut the noise (Pokemon, Plato, perfect numbers). Keep the signal (electricity costs, 1971, renewable energy percentage). Every question must serve the mission: revealing ignorance, correcting gaps, enabling sovereignty.

---

**Nobody will pay - because through knowledge, they won't have to.**

The survey reveals: you've been kept ignorant about money, energy, and Bitcoin by design. Now you know.
