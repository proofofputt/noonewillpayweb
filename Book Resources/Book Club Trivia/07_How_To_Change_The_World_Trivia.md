## Question 1: The Non-Attachment Paradox

**Question:** According to Batten, what is the relationship between caring about outcomes and winning pitches?

**A)** The more you care about winning, the more likely you are to succeed
**B)** You should care deeply about serving others while remaining unattached to whether they say yes
**C)** Detachment and indifference are the same thing and both help you win
**D)** Caring about outcomes shows passion that attracts investors

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Batten teaches the counterintuitive principle that "you win by caring deeply about serving the other person while remaining completely unattached to whether they say yes." Attachment creates desperation, which repels. Non-attachment creates presence and power. The more you need the outcome, the less likely you are to achieve it. This mirrors Eastern philosophy: do not attach to the fruit of your actions.

## Question 2: Feedback Interpretation

**Question:** What distinguishes growth mindset from fixed mindset when receiving pitch rejection?

**A)** Growth mindset blames the market; fixed mindset blames yourself
**B)** Growth mindset sees feedback as recipe for success; fixed mindset sees it as indictment of failure
**C)** Growth mindset ignores criticism; fixed mindset takes it personally
**D)** Growth mindset seeks more feedback; fixed mindset avoids future pitches

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Batten emphasizes that growth mindset interprets rejection as "Here's exactly what I need to improve" (recipe for success), while fixed mindset hears "I'm not good enough" (indictment of failure). He warns against "Prospect Blame Syndrome" (PBS)—blaming the audience ("they didn't get it") keeps you stuck by externalizing control. Growth mindset internalizes control by asking "What can I improve?"

## Question 3: The Problem-Solution Ratio

**Question:** According to Batten, what percentage of your pitch should focus on describing the problem versus the solution?

**A)** 25% problem, 75% solution (show your product quickly)
**B)** 50% problem, 50% solution (balanced approach)
**C)** 75% problem, 25% solution (establish emotional urgency first)
**D)** 90% problem, 10% solution (let them ask for details)

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Batten recommends spending 75% of pitch time on the problem, not the solution. Make the problem emotional, personal, and urgent. If people don't care about the problem, they won't care about your solution. Most pitches fail by reversing this—jumping immediately to "here's our cool product" before establishing why anyone should care. Emotional investment in the problem creates demand for the solution.

## Question 4: The Power of Pause

**Question:** When do decisions actually get made during your pitch according to Batten?

**A)** While you're explaining your most compelling data points
**B)** While you're telling your emotional story
**C)** While you're pausing, not while you're speaking
**D)** Immediately after you ask them to invest

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Batten states: "Decisions are not made while you're speaking, they're made while you're pausing." Inspiration literally happens when you're not talking. Pausing allows absorption, creates gravitas, and demonstrates confidence. Rushing to fill silence signals insecurity and overwhelms your audience. Most people fear silence and talk too much, precisely when they should be silent.

## Question 5: Simplicity Principle

**Question:** What Flesch Reading Ease score does Batten recommend for your pitch, and why?

**A)** Above 80 for maximum accessibility to all audiences
**B)** Above 60 (accessible to 13-15 year olds) to respect cognitive load
**C)** Above 40 for intelligent professional audiences
**D)** Below 30 to demonstrate expertise and sophistication

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Batten advocates for Flesch Reading Ease score above 60, accessible to 13-15 year olds. This isn't "dumbing down"—it's respecting your audience's cognitive load. Complexity demonstrates lack of self-awareness, not intelligence. When people hear two consecutive ideas they don't understand, they stop trying. True expertise is explaining complex ideas simply, not hiding behind jargon. Bruce Lee's wisdom: simplicity, brutality, directness.

## Question 6: The 16 Elements Framework

**Question:** Batten's framework organizes 16 elements of influential pitching into how many core dimensions?

**A)** 2 dimensions: Content and Delivery
**B)** 3 dimensions: Message, Mindset, and Mechanics
**C)** 4 dimensions: Mindset, Tactics, Delivery, and Message
**D)** 5 dimensions: Preparation, Opening, Body, Closing, Follow-up

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Batten structures his framework around four dimensions: Mindset (how you think—non-attachment, intention, growth mindset, conviction), Tactics (intelligent moves—anticipation, de-risking, momentum, bold asks), Delivery (how you present—energy, pause, tonality, physicality), and Message (what you say—questions, structure, rhetoric, story). You don't need to master all 16 perfectly; consistent application across dimensions creates exponential improvement.

## Question 7: The Seven-Minute Transformation

**Question:** What does Batten claim about the power of brief conversations?

**A)** Seven minutes is too short to change anyone's mind effectively
**B)** Pitches should always be longer than seven minutes for thoroughness
**C)** Seven minutes of mastery can undo years of underperformance
**D)** Seven minutes is the attention span limit before audiences disengage

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Batten shares multiple stories of pivotal seven-minute conversations that changed destinies. His insight: "Success is not about more time; it's about more powerful moments. Seven minutes of mastery can undo years of underperformance." We underestimate the transformative power of brief, bold, well-executed conversations. The difference between failure and extraordinary success is often a single conversation executed with the right framework.
