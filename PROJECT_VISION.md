# No One Will Pay - Project Vision & Purpose

## Executive Summary

No One Will Pay is a Bitcoin education and community platform centered around Washington, DC—the capital of the free world. The project combines a **common knowledge survey**, a **viral multi-level referral system**, comprehensive **Bitcoin education resources**, and **local community building** to create a movement that connects Bitcoiners through shared knowledge, economic incentives, and geographic proximity to political power centers.

The core thesis: **Sound money education delivered through gamification, incentive alignment, and community formation can accelerate Bitcoin adoption where it matters most—in the seat of global economic policy.**

## Part 1: The Common Knowledge Survey

### Purpose & Philosophy

The common knowledge survey is not a typical quiz. It serves four strategic purposes:

#### 1. **Knowledge Assessment Through Via Negativa**

Rather than teaching everything about Bitcoin, the survey identifies what people **don't know** and uses that gap to create curiosity. As Nassim Taleb's Via Negativa principle suggests, we often learn more by understanding our ignorance than by accumulating facts.

**The Survey Structure:**
- 21 questions spanning Bitcoin fundamentals, monetary history, energy policy, and technology
- Questions range from easy (1 point) to hard (3 points)
- Maximum score: ~45 points
- Categories include:
  - Bitcoin Fundamentals (halving, mining, blocks, difficulty)
  - Monetary History & Fiat (gold standard, inflation, currency failures)
  - Energy & Renewables (DMV electricity costs, SRECs, Clean Energy goals)
  - Economic Metrics (inflation rates, cost of living)
  - Technology & Internet Culture (HTTP codes, private keys, Bitcoin pizza day)

**Why These Questions?**
Each question reveals a hidden connection between Bitcoin, sound money, energy economics, and political power:

- **"How many Bitcoins have been mined?"** → Reveals scarcity consciousness
- **"In what year did Nixon end the Gold Standard?"** → Connects monetary history to modern inflation
- **"What percentage of Bitcoin mining uses renewable energy?"** → Challenges the "Bitcoin wastes energy" narrative
- **"How many electoral votes to win presidency?"** → Connects political power (270) to symbolic Bitcoin numbers (21M, 2.1 quadrillion sats)
- **"How many minutes to mine a block?"** → Introduces proof-of-work time preference

#### 2. **Common Knowledge Creation**

The survey creates **Schelling points**—focal points for coordination. When participants know that others in their community are taking the same survey, they gain:

- **Shared vocabulary**: Everyone learns the same core concepts (stock-to-flow, time preference, proof-of-work)
- **Conversation starters**: "Did you take the Nobody•Will•Pay survey? What did you score?"
- **Community identity**: "I'm a 38/45" becomes a badge of Bitcoin knowledge

This is critical in the DMV area where:
- Policy conversations require technical literacy
- Bitcoiners need to coordinate across DC, Maryland, and Virginia
- Influencing regulation requires a critical mass of educated advocates

#### 3. **Behavior Change Through Incentives**

The survey doesn't just measure knowledge—it **rewards learning** through a sophisticated incentive system:

**Allocation Points System:**
- Base score: Your quiz performance (0-45 points)
- Direct referral bonus: **21.00 points** per person you refer
- 2nd degree referrals: **10.50 points** (Bitcoin-style halving)
- 3rd degree referrals: **5.25 points** (50% halving)
- 4th degree referrals: **2.25 points** (custom reduction)
- 5th degree referrals: **1.125 points** (50% halving)

**Why Bitcoin-Style Halving?**
The points structure **mimics Bitcoin's supply schedule**, teaching participants about:
- Scarcity through decreasing rewards
- Network effects through multi-level incentives
- Long-term thinking through compounding benefits
- Mathematical predictability through fixed formulas

**Real-World Value:**
Allocation points will be used for:
- Priority access to DMV Bitcoin events (meetups, conferences, workshops)
- Exclusive educational resources and GitBook access
- Voting rights in community decisions
- Future Bitcoin-denominated rewards (potential airdrops, prizes, grants)

#### 4. **Viral Growth Mechanism**

The survey is designed to spread through **authentic social networks** using three distribution channels:

**A. Digital Referrals**
- Every participant receives a unique referral code
- Shareable via link, QR code, or direct invitation
- Multi-level tracking shows your entire referral tree
- Dashboard displays: direct referrals, 2nd-5th degree referrals, total points earned

**B. Physical Sticker Codes**
- Admins generate batches of unique QR code stickers
- First person to scan a sticker **claims ownership**
- All subsequent scans are **automatically referred by the claimer**
- Creates "territory claiming" game mechanics
- Stickers placed at: coffee shops, coworking spaces, Bitcoin ATMs, meetup venues

**Example:**
```
Alice finds sticker at coffee shop → Claims it → Gets her referral code
Bob scans same sticker → Automatically referred by Alice → Alice gets 21 points
Carol scans same sticker → Automatically referred by Alice → Alice gets another 21 points
```

**C. Community Evangelism**
- Book club participants receive custom bookmarks with Cashu tokens
- Workshop attendees get stickers to distribute
- Meetup organizers become "allocation point farmers"
- Bitcoin businesses incentivized to display QR codes

---

### Survey Design: Pill Selection & Symbolic Meaning

Each question is labeled with a **pill color** that references the "red pill / blue pill" Matrix metaphor, extended to Bitcoin culture:

**🟠 Orange Pill (Bitcoin Fundamentals, Sound Money)**
- Represents Bitcoin awakening
- Questions about BTC supply, mining, proof-of-work, private keys
- 14 questions in this category
- Hardest to answer for newcomers, most rewarding to learn

**🟢 Green Pill (Energy, Renewables, Sustainability)**
- Represents environmental consciousness
- Questions about renewable mining, DMV electricity costs, SRECs, Clean Energy goals
- 7 questions in this category
- Challenges "Bitcoin destroys environment" narrative
- Connects Bitcoin mining to renewable energy grid stabilization

**Mixed Questions**
- Some questions integrate both: "What % of mining uses renewables?" (Orange pill question with Green pill implications)
- Forces participants to see Bitcoin and sustainability as complementary, not opposed

**The Symbolic Architecture:**
- 21 questions (21 million Bitcoin cap)
- Points scored out of ~45 (Bitcoin's genesis block reward: 50, minus the 5 burned sats)
- Referral bonus: 21.00 points (21 million cap)
- Difficulty adjustment every 2,016 blocks → Question 17 about 2,016 blocks
- HTTP 404 (Not Found) → Nobody•Will•Pay domain Easter egg
- 270 electoral votes → 270 symbolic points for political power

This **numerological consistency** creates cognitive resonance—every number reinforces Bitcoin's fundamental properties.

## Part 2: The Vision for DMV Bitcoin Community

### Why the DMV? Why Now?

#### Strategic Geographic Importance

**The Capital of the Free World:**
Washington, DC is not just another city. It is:
- The seat of U.S. federal government
- Home to the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, SEC, CFTC
- Where Bitcoin regulation is written
- Where monetary policy is decided
- Where international financial agreements are negotiated
- The epicenter of global financial power

**Unique Opportunity:**
- **Policy makers are concentrated here**: Senators, representatives, staffers, lobbyists all live in DMV
- **Regulatory discussions happen here**: SEC decisions, Treasury guidance, Congressional hearings
- **Media amplification**: DC journalists, think tanks, policy institutes amplify local narratives
- **International influence**: Foreign diplomats, IMF/World Bank officials, central bankers visit regularly
- **Tech talent**: Northern Virginia (Fairfax, Arlington, Alexandria) has top-tier developer concentration

**The Thesis:**
If you can create a critical mass of Bitcoin-literate, technically competent, politically engaged advocates **in Washington, DC**, you can:
1. Influence regulation before it's written
2. Educate policy makers in person
3. Counter misinformation at the source
4. Demonstrate real-world Bitcoin use cases
5. Build legitimacy through visible community

#### The DMV Bitcoin Ecosystem Today

**Strengths:**
- **High-income population**: Median household income $80k-$120k+ across DMV
- **Tech-savvy residents**: Cybersecurity professionals, government IT contractors, developers
- **International diversity**: Diplomats, immigrants, expats understand currency instability
- **Entrepreneurial culture**: Startups, consultants, policy entrepreneurs
- **Government/private sector mix**: Unique blend of regulatory expertise and market knowledge

**Challenges:**
- **Risk-averse professionals**: Government employees fear regulatory blowback
- **Political considerations**: Partisan associations create hesitation
- **Regulatory uncertainty**: Working in DC means working in compliance culture
- **Conservative finance culture**: Traditional banking mindset dominates

**Current State:**
- DC Bitcoin Meetup: 50-150 attendees monthly
- Baltimore Bitcoin: 20-50 attendees
- Northern Virginia Bitcoin: 30-75 attendees
- DMV Ordinals & Runes: 500+ Discord members
- Bitcoin Policy Institute: Quarterly conferences with 100-300 attendees
- Annual DMV Bitcoin Conference: 300-800 attendees

**The Gap:**
Despite these assets, there's no **unified DMV Bitcoin identity**. No common knowledge base. No coordinated advocacy. No systematic onboarding. No gamified incentive structure. No viral growth mechanism.

**Nobody•Will•Pay aims to fill this gap.**

2. **Point-of-sale incentives**: Businesses earn allocation points for accepting Bitcoin
3. **Customer rewards**: Customers who pay in Bitcoin earn bonus allocation points
4. **Directory integration**: BTCMap.org + local DMV Bitcoin map
5. **Sticker distribution**: Every participating business displays a QR code sticker

**Example Flow:**
```
1. Alice takes survey → Scores 38/45 → Gets referral code
2. Alice visits District Taco → Scans their sticker → Pays with Lightning
3. Alice earns 5 bonus points for first Bitcoin payment
4. Bob scans sticker at District Taco → Referred by Alice (21 points to Alice)
5. District Taco tracks usage → Sees 50 new customers from sticker
6. District Taco requests more stickers → Becomes distribution hub
```

#### Pillar 4: Policy Advocacy & Regulatory Engagement

**The DMV Advantage:**

Bitcoin advocates in DMV have **unique access to power**:

**Direct Engagement Opportunities:**
- Congressional hearings (Capitol Hill)
- SEC/CFTC comment periods (downtown DC)
- Federal Reserve events (Eccles Building)
- Treasury Department briefings
- Think tank events (Cato, Heritage, AEI, Brookings)
- White House crypto policy discussions

**Bitcoin Policy Institute:**
- Quarterly events in DC
- Chatham House Rule discussions
- Policy professionals only
- **Integration**: Advanced survey takers (40+ points) get invitations

**Grassroots Advocacy:**
- **The Ask**: Every survey taker commits to one advocacy action:
  - Write to representative about Bitcoin
  - Submit SEC comment on crypto rules
  - Attend public hearing
  - Join Bitcoin Policy Institute
  - Share educational content with policy maker

**Why This Matters:**
The difference between **Bitcoin-hostile regulation** and **Bitcoin-neutral regulation** could be $trillions in value and millions of users. Having 10,000 educated Bitcoin advocates in DC creates a **political force** that cannot be ignored.

#### Pillar 5: Viral Growth Through Incentive Alignment

**The Multi-Level Referral Flywheel:**

The system creates a **compounding growth engine**:

**Stage 1: Early Adopters (0-100 participants)**
- Bitcoin OGs in DMV take survey
- Each refers 5 friends (family, coworkers, meetup members)
- Each earns 105 points (21 × 5)
- Network grows to 500 people

**Stage 2: Network Effects (100-1,000 participants)**
- Those 500 people each refer 3 more
- Original adopters now have 2nd degree referrals
- Original adopters earning 52.5 points per 2nd degree referral (10.5 × 5)
- Network grows to 1,500 people
- Sticker distribution begins

**Stage 3: Exponential Phase (1,000-10,000 participants)**
- Stickers placed at 50+ high-traffic locations
- Each sticker generates 20-50 scans
- Sticker claimers become allocation point farmers
- 3rd, 4th, and 5th degree referrals activate
- Network grows to 10,000+ people

**Stage 4: Critical Mass (10,000+ participants)**
- 10,000 survey completions in DMV area
- Represents ~1% of Bitcoin holders in DC metro
- Creates **common knowledge**: "Everyone has taken the Nobody•Will•Pay survey"
- Politicians notice: "My constituents are asking about Bitcoin"
- Media covers: "DC Bitcoin community organizes through gamified survey"
- Policy impact: Bitcoin literacy becomes political asset

**Example: One Person's Network Effect**

```
Alice (Early Adopter)
├─ Direct referrals (5 people): 5 × 21 = 105 points
├─ 2nd degree (5 × 3 = 15 people): 15 × 10.5 = 157.5 points
├─ 3rd degree (15 × 3 = 45 people): 45 × 5.25 = 236.25 points
├─ 4th degree (45 × 3 = 135 people): 135 × 2.25 = 303.75 points
├─ 5th degree (135 × 3 = 405 people): 405 × 1.125 = 455.625 points

Total network from Alice: 605 people
Total points to Alice: 1,258.125 points
Alice's survey score: 42 points
Alice's total allocation: 1,300.125 points
```

**Alice becomes a community leader** with high allocation points, giving her:
- Priority conference tickets
- Speaking opportunities at meetups
- Voting power in community decisions
- Recognition as Bitcoin educator

**The Incentive Alignment:**
- **Individuals**: Earn points, build reputation, access resources
- **Businesses**: Get customers, demonstrate Bitcoin utility
- **Organizers**: Grow community, increase meetup attendance
- **Policy makers**: Understand constituent interest in Bitcoin
- **Bitcoin ecosystem**: Gains educated advocates in capital city

## Part 3: The Via Negativa Philosophy

### Power Through Constraint

The entire Nobody•Will•Pay project embodies **Via Negativa**—the principle that power comes from **what you remove**, not what you add.

**Bitcoin's Via Negativa:**
- Bitcoin succeeds by **removing** the ability to inflate supply
- Security comes from **removing** trusted third parties
- Immutability comes from **removing** the ability to change rules
- Sovereignty comes from **removing** government control

**The Survey's Via Negativa:**
- Measures what you **don't know** (ignorance), not what you know
- Teaches through **removing** misconceptions, not adding facts
- Rewards **not spending** (accumulating points), not spending them
- Grows through **removing** friction, not adding marketing

**Sound Money's Via Negativa:**
- Prosperity comes from **not consuming** now (saving), not consuming more
- Freedom comes from **removing** government monetary control, not reforming it
- Stability comes from **removing** central bank manipulation, not perfecting it

**Sustainable Energy's Via Negativa:**
- Solar succeeds by **removing** subsidies, not adding them
- Grid stability comes from **removing** baseload constraints through batteries
- Bitcoin mining **removes** wasted energy from the system

**Personal Via Negativa:**
- Health comes from **removing** processed food, not adding supplements
- Clarity comes from **removing** distractions, not adding productivity tools
- Wealth comes from **removing** debt, not increasing income

### Connection to Book Resources

The project includes 12+ books exploring Via Negativa across domains:

**Money:**
- The Bitcoin Standard: Sound money removes government control
- The Fiat Standard: Fiat money adds government control (opposite of Via Negativa)

**Energy:**
- Taming the Sun: Renewable energy succeeds by removing subsidies
- BOOM AND BUST: Energy markets fail when governments add interventions

**Philosophy:**
- The Sovereign Individual: Freedom comes from removing state dependency
- How to Change the World: Persuasion works by removing objections, not adding arguments

**Technology:**
- Mastering Bitcoin: Bitcoin's code removes trusted parties through cryptography
- The Blocksize Wars: Bitcoin preserved by removing the temptation to scale via bigger blocks

**This thematic consistency** creates intellectual coherence—every element reinforces the same principle.

## Conclusion: The Stakes

### Why This Matters

**The Battle for Bitcoin's Future Will Be Won or Lost in Washington, DC.**

- **Regulation can kill Bitcoin adoption** (China's mining ban, Nigeria's bank restrictions)
- **Or regulation can enable Bitcoin adoption** (El Salvador's legal tender, Switzerland's friendly framework)
- **The difference is measured in millions of users and billions of dollars**

**The United States will decide Bitcoin's fate for the Western world.**
- If the U.S. bans Bitcoin, most Western nations follow
- If the U.S. embraces Bitcoin, most Western nations follow
- **And U.S. policy is written in Washington, DC**

**We Have a Narrow Window of Opportunity:**
- Bitcoin is still early (2% global adoption)
- Policy makers are still learning
- Narratives are still being formed
- Coalitions are still being built
- **The next 2-4 years determine the next 20-40 years**

### The Nobody•Will•Pay Advantage

**We have what others don't:**

1. **Geographic advantage**: We live where power is
2. **Educational infrastructure**: Comprehensive 0-100 curriculum
3. **Incentive alignment**: Multi-level referral system with real rewards
4. **Community foundation**: Existing meetups, businesses, advocates
5. **Intellectual framework**: Via Negativa philosophy unifying all elements
6. **Growth mechanism**: Viral sticker distribution + digital referrals
7. **Policy access**: Direct lines to Congressional staff, agencies, think tanks

**Most Bitcoin communities focus on price speculation.**
**We focus on policy influence.**

**Most Bitcoin education is scattered and inconsistent.**
**We provide systematic 0-100 progression.**

**Most Bitcoin adoption efforts lack incentive alignment.**
**We game-ify learning and community building.**

**Most Bitcoin advocates are geographically dispersed.**
**We concentrate in the seat of global financial power.**

### The Call to Action

**The survey is not just a quiz.**
**It's a coordination mechanism.**
**It's a Schelling point.**
**It's a signal that says: "I understand sound money, and I'm in Washington, DC."**

**When 10,000 people have taken this survey, we will have:**
- Common knowledge (we all know the same facts)
- Common language (we speak the same Bitcoin vocabulary)
- Common goals (we want Bitcoin-friendly policy)
- Common incentives (we benefit from network growth)
- Common identity (we're the DMV Bitcoin community)

**And that's when we become a political force.**

**That's when Senators' staff members say:** "We're getting emails from hundreds of constituents about this Bitcoin bill."

**That's when Treasury officials say:** "The DMV Bitcoin community submitted detailed technical feedback."

**That's when journalists say:** "Bitcoin advocates in DC have organized around this survey platform."

**That's when the world says:** "Washington, DC isn't just the fiat capital anymore. It's becoming the Bitcoin capital."
