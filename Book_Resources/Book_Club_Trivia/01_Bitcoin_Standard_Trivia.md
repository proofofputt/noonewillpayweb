## Question 1: Time Preference and Life Success

**Question:** According to Ammous, what is the most important set of trades affecting an individual's well-being?

**A)** Trades with employers for wages and benefits
**B)** Trades with their future self (time preference decisions)
**C)** Trades with family members for mutual support
**D)** Trades with governments through taxation

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Ammous argues that "the most important trades that affect any individual's well-being are the ones they conduct in their trade-offs with their future self." This encapsulates time preference—how you value present versus future satisfaction. The book demonstrates that low time preference (delayed gratification) correlates strongly with life success, regardless of initial talents or circumstances.

## Question 2: The Bezzle Economy

**Question:** What does Ammous mean by "the bezzle" in the context of fiat monetary inflation?

**A)** Legitimate businesses that benefit from economic growth
**B)** Black market economic activity that evades taxation
**C)** Economic activity that exists only because of inflation and produces no real value
**D)** International trade that bypasses domestic regulations

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** "The bezzle" refers to all economic activity that exists solely to capture newly printed money—jobs, industries, and institutions producing nothing of value but thriving on monetary inflation. Examples include much of the bloated financial sector, administrative expansion in academia, and government bureaucracies. This represents a massive misallocation of human resources and talent that sound money would eliminate.

## Question 3: The Easy Money Trap

**Question:** According to The Bitcoin Standard, what inevitably happens when something successfully assumes a monetary role?

**A)** Its industrial uses decline as monetary premium increases
**B)** Governments regulate it to protect consumers
**C)** Its supply increases, and if easily increased, destroys savers' wealth
**D)** International trade adopts it as the global reserve currency

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Ammous explains the "easy money trap": anything used as money will see increased production attempts. If supply can be easily increased, the new supply destroys the wealth of those using it as a store of value. This explains why seashells, silver, and fiat currencies have failed as money over time, while gold maintained monetary status for millennia due to its high stock-to-flow ratio.

## Question 4: Capital Market Socialism

**Question:** What does Ammous mean when he states "In every country in the world there is a central planning board for the most important market of all"?

**A)** International trade agreements require central coordination
**B)** Labor markets are controlled by government employment agencies
**C)** The capital market (interest rates, money supply) is centrally planned by central banks
**D)** Housing markets are regulated by government zoning boards

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Despite claiming to support free markets, every modern economy centrally plans the most critical market—the capital market. Central banks manipulate interest rates and money supply, destroying the price signals that would otherwise coordinate resources efficiently. This "capital market socialism" causes the boom-bust business cycles blamed on capitalism but actually caused by central planning.

## Question 5: Network Immutability

**Question:** Why is Bitcoin's difficulty to change considered its most valuable property according to Ammous?

**A)** It prevents hackers from stealing bitcoin through code changes
**B)** It ensures backwards compatibility with older wallet software
**C)** It prevents any entity from manipulating Bitcoin like fiat currency
**D)** It makes Bitcoin mining more profitable over time

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Ammous argues that "nobody controlling Bitcoin" is its core value proposition, not a flaw to be fixed. Bitcoin's immutability—the fact that changing core properties requires coordinating thousands of independent nodes with opposite incentives—protects it from the political manipulation that plagues fiat currency. This counterintuitive insight is essential: Bitcoin's power comes from what cannot be done to it.

## Question 6: Stock-to-Flow Ratio

**Question:** What does the stock-to-flow ratio measure, and why is it the single most important monetary metric?

**A)** The ratio of money in savings accounts to money in circulation
**B)** Existing supply divided by annual new production—measuring monetary hardness
**C)** The flow of money from developed to developing nations
**D)** Stock market valuation relative to economic output

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The stock-to-flow ratio (existing supply ÷ annual production) is the key to understanding monetary history. Gold's ratio of ~60 means it would take 60 years of current mining to double existing supply. This hardness made gold money for millennia. Bitcoin's ratio exceeds gold's and approaches infinity as production halts around 2140, making it the hardest money ever created.

## Question 7: Sound Money and Government Size

**Question:** According to Ammous, what is the relationship between sound money and government power?

**A)** Sound money strengthens government by providing stable tax revenue
**B)** Sound money enables larger social programs through economic growth
**C)** Sound money constrains government by removing the inflation tax
**D)** Sound money has no effect on government size or scope

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Sound money that governments cannot inflate forces them to seek consent through taxation, dramatically constraining government size and scope. The 20th century's unprecedented government growth, deadliest wars, and loss of individual liberty all correlate with government control of money. The inflation tax funds wars and bureaucracies that would be impossible under sound money, where citizens would immediately feel the cost through taxation.
