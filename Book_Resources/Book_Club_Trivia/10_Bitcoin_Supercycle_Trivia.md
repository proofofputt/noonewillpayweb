**Book:** Bitcoin Supercycle: How the crypto calendar can make you rich
**Author:** Michael Terpin
**Total Questions:** 7

## Question 1: The Four Seasons Definition

**Question:** According to Terpin's framework, what event marks the beginning of Bitcoin Spring?

**A)** When Bitcoin breaks above the previous cycle's all-time high
**B)** The day of the halving event
**C)** When capitulation occurs and prices stabilize
**D)** When miner profitability returns to positive levels

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Terpin clearly defines: "Bitcoin Spring begins the day of the halving." This creates an objective, verifiable marker rather than subjective interpretation. Summer begins when prior ATH is exceeded, Fall begins the day after new ATH, and Winter begins at capitulation (though this is only clear in hindsight). The framework provides structure to seemingly chaotic markets.

## Question 2: The Historical Pattern

**Question:** What consistent timing pattern have all post-halving cycle peaks followed according to the book?

**A)** Peaks occur exactly 18 months after each halving
**B)** All cycle peaks occurred in Q4 of the year following the halving
**C)** Peaks happen when Bitcoin dominance falls below 40%
**D)** Cycle tops align with stock market peaks

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The book documents that all post-halving peaks occurred in Q4 of the year following the halving: November 2013, December 2017, November 2021. However, the 2024-2025 cycle broke precedent by hitting new ATH BEFORE the halving (March 2024), showing that patterns evolve. Understanding historical consistency while recognizing variation is essential for successful cycle navigation.

## Question 3: Scarcity Milestone

**Question:** What monetary milestone did Bitcoin achieve after the April 2024 halving?

**A)** Bitcoin's market cap exceeded gold's market cap
**B)** Bitcoin's inflation rate (0.825%) became less than half of gold's (~1.7%), making Bitcoin scarcer than gold
**C)** Bitcoin's transaction volume surpassed Visa's daily transactions
**D)** Bitcoin's hash rate exceeded all previous records by 10x

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Terpin notes: "After the April 2024 halving, Bitcoin's annual inflation rate dropped to 0.825% - less than half the current annual inflation of gold at approximately 1.7%. Bitcoin officially became scarcer than gold." This watershed moment in monetary history creates a fundamental value proposition: for the first time, a monetary asset demonstrably scarcer than gold exists, with inflation approaching zero asymptotically.

## Question 4: Miner Economics

**Question:** How does the halving immediately affect miners according to Terpin?

**A)** Miners become more profitable due to increased Bitcoin price
**B)** A miner with 2% profit margin at 900 BTC/day rewards is now losing 37.5% daily when rewards drop to 450 BTC/day
**C)** Mining difficulty automatically decreases to maintain profitability
**D)** Miners switch to mining altcoins for better returns

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The book explains: "Each new halving makes the majority of miners unprofitable until the difficulty levels adjust and/or new mining equipment arrives. A miner with a 2% profit margin when daily rewards were at 900 bitcoins is now losing 37.5% every day when the rewards dropped to 450 bitcoins." This miner capitulation often creates Bitcoin Spring's temporary price suppression as miners sell holdings to cover costs, creating accumulation opportunities.

## Question 5: News Relativity Paradigm

**Question:** What pattern does Terpin identify about how markets interpret news in different seasons?

**A)** Good news always drives prices up regardless of market conditions
**B)** In bull markets good news is exaggerated and bad news minimized; in bear markets this inverts
**C)** News has no effect on Bitcoin prices since markets are efficient
**D)** Social media sentiment determines how news is interpreted

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Terpin observes: "In bull markets, the good news gets exaggerated while bad news gets minimized or ignored. The reverse is also true: in a bitcoin bear market, good news is ignored, whereas bad news is magnified." This explains seemingly irrational market reactions. The same news gets opposite reactions depending on emotional state. Learning to read market reaction to news, not just the news itself, signals season transitions.

## Question 6: The Supercycle Catalyst

**Question:** What defines a "Supercycle" versus a normal four-year cycle?

**A)** Government adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender
**B)** When demand exceeds supply by a level that disrupts price beyond diminishing returns
**C)** When Bitcoin's market cap exceeds $10 trillion
**D)** When cycle peaks exceed 10x from previous highs

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Terpin defines: "When demand exceeds supply by a level that disrupts price beyond diminishing returns, you get a Supercycle." The ETF approval in January 2024 created structural demand exceeding new mined supply by 2-4x daily. If sustained for years, this creates unprecedented supply shortage, potentially extending Summer seasons, creating gentler corrections, and pushing prices beyond traditional diminishing returns models. The Supercycle thesis projects at least 12 years (3+ cycles) of exponential growth before maturation.

## Question 7: Winter's Gift

**Question:** According to Terpin, what makes Bitcoin Winter both the longest season and the best opportunity?

**A)** Winter prices always represent the absolute bottom
**B)** Winter's extended pessimism (12-18 months) tests resolve but creates deepest value for those who accumulate
**C)** Winter is when altcoins outperform Bitcoin
**D)** Mining becomes most profitable during Winter

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The book states: "Bitcoin Winter is always the longest season. The end of Winter is absolutely the best time to buy, like the end of Summer is the best time to sell." Winter's length (often 12-18 months) creates psychological brutalityâ€”declining prices while media proclaims Bitcoin's death. Yet this extended despair creates the deepest opportunities. Those who bought Winter 2018 ($3,200) and Winter 2022 ($15,500) saw 10x+ returns within 24 months. Success in Winter requires removing fear and systematically accumulating.
