# The Blocksize War - Book Club Trivia

**Book:** The Blocksize War
**Author:** Jonathan Bier
**Total Questions:** 7

## Question 1: The Fundamental Question

**Question:** According to Bier, what realization about Bitcoin's governance occurred during the Blocksize War?

**A)** Bitcoin needs formal voting mechanisms to make decisions
**B)** If Bitcoin couldn't resist capture by a few hundred people, how could it withstand nation-states?
**C)** Miners should have ultimate control over protocol changes
**D)** Developers must be able to implement changes quickly for Bitcoin to compete

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Bier writes: "If we cannot resolve this dispute now, when only a few hundred people really care about it, what hope does Bitcoin really have?" The war tested whether Bitcoin could resist capture from relatively small-scale corporate pressure. If venture-backed companies and mining pools could force protocol changes, Bitcoin would be helpless against nation-states and major financial institutions as it grew. The successful resistance proved Bitcoin's genuine decentralization.

## Question 2: Status Quo Bias as Feature

**Question:** What did the small blockers realize about Bitcoin's governance philosophy?

**A)** Bitcoin needs efficient processes to implement beneficial changes
**B)** Rules must be very difficult to change or Bitcoin won't withstand pressure from powerful interests
**C)** Satoshi's original design should never be modified
**D)** Democratic voting should determine all protocol upgrades

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The book explains: "I began to realize that the rules of the network had to be robust. It had to be really difficult to change the rules, otherwise it would not stand up to the pressure from the main financial establishment." And critically: "The status quo had to be defined somehow. There had to be dynamics in place to ensure the status quo would survive and prevail." Bitcoin's strength comes from making changes nearly impossible without overwhelming consensus—inertia protects decentralization.

## Question 3: Mining Power Misconception

**Question:** What fundamental misunderstanding did large blockers have about miners' role in Bitcoin?

**A)** Miners provide all of Bitcoin's security
**B)** Miners control Bitcoin's rules through block production
**C)** Miners only decide transaction order, not protocol rules
**D)** Miners don't matter because users enforce all rules

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The book captures the miners' misconception: "Miners had said that they have real businesses, they invested real money and they produce the blocks, giving them real power over the network." Small blockers countered: "Proof of work was there to solve the double spending problem; miners merely decide on the order of transactions." This distinction was crucial—miners order transactions but users running nodes enforce validity rules. UASF proved users could force miners' hands.

## Question 4: Corporate Capture Attempt

**Question:** What letter did major Bitcoin companies send to support larger blocks, and what did it reveal?

**A)** A letter signed by central banks supporting 8MB blocks
**B)** A letter from BitPay, Coinbase, Xapo and others claiming BIP 101 and 8MB blocks had "majority support"
**C)** A petition from individual users requesting immediate block size increases
**D)** A technical paper from cryptographers proving large blocks were safe

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The book documents: "It is imperative that we plan for success by raising the maximum block size. BIP 101 and 8MB blocks are supported by a majority of the community and we feel it is time for the industry to unite behind this proposal" signed by CEOs of BitPay, Blockchain.info, Circle, Coinbase, Xapo, and BitGo. This was the opening salvo—venture-backed companies claiming to speak for "the community" while pushing changes that would benefit their business models at the cost of decentralization.

## Question 5: Strategic Vision Divergence

**Question:** Why did small blockers believe competing on payments was strategically naive?

**A)** Bitcoin's slow transaction times made payments impossible
**B)** Centralized payment services can simply lower fees and speed up, but cannot compete with unblockable electronic transactions
**C)** Governments would ban Bitcoin if it competed with Visa and Mastercard
**D)** Lightning Network already solved all payment needs

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The book explains: "If Bitcoin gains traction, these payment services can simply lower fees and speed up transaction times...In contrast, becoming a new form of money, capable of unblockable electronic transactions, was something the traditional financial establishment would be unable to compete with." Competing on payments played to incumbents' strengths. Bitcoin's unique value proposition is censorship-resistant money, which requires decentralization that small blocks preserve.

## Question 6: User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF)

**Question:** What did UASF prove about Bitcoin's power structure?

**A)** Miners ultimately control Bitcoin through hashpower
**B)** Developers can force changes through code commits
**C)** Users running nodes can enforce rules and force miner compliance
**D)** Exchanges determine Bitcoin's rules through listing decisions

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** UASF was a mechanism where users running full nodes activated SegWit on a specific date regardless of miner signaling. If miners didn't comply, their blocks would be rejected by user nodes. This reversed the power dynamic—users forced miners to comply. Economic nodes (exchanges, merchants) running UASF nodes created economic pressure that made miner resistance futile. This proved genuine decentralization: grassroots user resistance could overcome corporate and miner coalition.

## Question 7: Consequences of Winning

**Question:** What precedent did the small blocker victory establish for Bitcoin's future?

**A)** Developers should implement changes requested by businesses
**B)** Miners should signal support before any changes activate
**C)** Protocol changes require user consent, not corporate backing; governance favors status quo
**D)** Block size can be increased in the future when technology improves

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The Blocksize War's resolution established that: Bitcoin's rules are genuinely difficult to change, governance favors the status quo, protocol changes require overwhelming user consensus (not corporate lobbying or miner signaling), and grassroots resistance can overcome well-funded corporate pressure. This precedent makes Bitcoin more credibly resistant to future capture attempts by nation-states or financial institutions.
