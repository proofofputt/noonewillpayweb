## Question 1: Money's Abstract Nature

**Question:** According to Decrypting Money, what surprising truth about money's history challenges the assumption that Bitcoin is "weird" for being digital?

**A)** All money was originally backed by gold or silver
**B)** Money has been abstract from the very beginning
**C)** Physical money always preceded digital representations
**D)** Governments have always controlled money creation

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The book reveals that "money seems to have been an abstraction from the beginning, and its history is full of abstraction." Cowry shells had minimal practical use; their value came from social agreement. Each step in money's evolution added abstraction—from useful commodities to decorative objects to precious metals to paper to fiat to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's digital nature is the natural continuation of this pattern, not a break from it.

## Question 2: Mining Incentive Structure

**Question:** Why does Decrypting Money argue that mining Bitcoin is "economically more attractive" than attacking the network?

**A)** Governments subsidize honest miners with tax benefits
**B)** Mining pools share profits equally among all participants
**C)** Attempting to attack Bitcoin is like "stealing paper money by setting it on fire"
**D)** Mining equipment has high resale value if you stop mining

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The book explains that proof-of-work makes attacking Bitcoin economically irrational. Successfully attacking would require spending more energy than could be gained, making it as absurd as burning paper money to steal it. The elegance of Bitcoin's design is that honest mining is always more profitable than dishonest behavior, aligning selfish economic incentives with network security.

## Question 3: Satoshi's Design Philosophy

**Question:** Why did Satoshi use existing, proven cryptographic techniques rather than inventing new ones for Bitcoin?

**A)** Satoshi lacked advanced cryptography knowledge
**B)** Patent restrictions prevented using newer methods
**C)** Newly invented components haven't been tested enough to be trustworthy
**D)** Older techniques require less computing power

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Decrypting Money emphasizes that "newer isn't better" when it comes to cryptography. Satoshi deliberately used battle-tested cryptographic primitives (SHA-256, ECDSA) that had been extensively analyzed and proven secure. The innovation was in combining proven components in a novel way, not in inventing untested cryptography that might contain hidden vulnerabilities.

## Question 4: Privacy vs. Secrecy

**Question:** According to Decrypting Money, what is the crucial distinction between privacy and secrecy in the context of Bitcoin?

**A)** Privacy means hiding illegal activity; secrecy means legitimate confidentiality
**B)** Privacy is selective revelation; secrecy is revealing to no one
**C)** Privacy applies to individuals; secrecy applies to governments
**D)** Privacy is temporary; secrecy is permanent

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The book provides a profound definition: "Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is power to selectively reveal oneself to the world." Bitcoin's pseudonymity gives users this power—transactions are public, but identity revelation is optional and controlled by the user.

## Question 5: Bitcoin as Dual System

**Question:** What fundamental distinction does Decrypting Money make about Bitcoin that separates it from all previous monetary systems?

**A)** Bitcoin is faster and cheaper than traditional banking
**B)** Bitcoin is both a currency AND a payment system combined
**C)** Bitcoin can be divided into smaller units than any previous money
**D)** Bitcoin operates 24/7 without business hours

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The book emphasizes this crucial insight: "Bitcoin is both a currency and a payment system." Previously, the currency (dollar bills, gold coins) was always separate from the payment system (banks, credit cards, wire transfers). Bitcoin combines these for the first time in history, enabling peer-to-peer value transfer with no intermediary required. This unification is revolutionary, not just convenient.

## Question 6: Six Essential Money Properties

**Question:** Which six traits does Decrypting Money identify as essential for good money, and how does Bitcoin perform?

**A)** Scarcity, durability, portability, divisibility, fungibility, security—Bitcoin scores highest on all
**B)** Acceptability, stability, legality, popularity, government backing, insurance—Bitcoin scores mixed
**C)** Speed, privacy, reversibility, customer support, brand recognition, marketing—Bitcoin underperforms
**D)** Simplicity, tradition, familiarity, regulation, institutional trust, insurance—Bitcoin fails most

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:** The book establishes six essential traits: scarcity (limited supply), durability (doesn't degrade), portability (easy to transport), divisibility (can split into smaller units), fungibility (units interchangeable), and security (resistant to counterfeiting). Bitcoin scores perfectly on all six—something no physical commodity ever achieved. This comprehensive superiority across all monetary properties is what makes Bitcoin ideal money.

## Question 7: Satoshis and Accessibility

**Question:** What is a satoshi, and why does it matter for Bitcoin adoption?

**A)** A satoshi is 0.01 BTC, allowing people to buy affordable fractions
**B)** A satoshi is the creator's name, honoring Bitcoin's anonymous founder
**C)** A satoshi is 0.00000001 BTC (one hundred-millionth), enabling universal access
**D)** A satoshi is a type of wallet for secure bitcoin storage

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** As defined in the book: "Satoshi: the smallest division (one one-hundred-millionth) of bitcoin." Each bitcoin divides into 100,000,000 satoshis, enabling transactions of any size. This extreme divisibility means Bitcoin works whether you're buying coffee, tipping content creators, or settling million-dollar trades. When people say "Bitcoin is too expensive," they misunderstand this divisibility—you don't need to buy a whole coin any more than you need a million dollars to use dollars.
