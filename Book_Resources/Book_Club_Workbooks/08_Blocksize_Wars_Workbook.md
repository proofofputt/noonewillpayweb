# The Blocksize War - Book Club Discussion Workbook

## Book Overview

**Author:** Jonathan Bier
**Publication Year:** 2021
**Core Thesis:** The Blocksize War chronicles Bitcoin's most existential governance crisis (August 2015 - November 2017), where corporate-backed forces attempted to increase Bitcoin's block size limit through protocol-level changes, only to be defeated by grassroots user resistance that proved Bitcoin's decentralization and resistance to capture.

**Why This Governance Drama Matters:**

This book documents Bitcoin's immune system in action. The war wasn't just about technical parameters—it was about who controls Bitcoin: venture-backed corporations or users running nodes. The resolution proved that Bitcoin's rules are genuinely difficult to change, validating the network's resilience against powerful economic interests. If Bitcoin couldn't resist capture during this relatively small-scale conflict involving "only a few hundred people," how could it withstand pressure from nation-states and major financial institutions as it grows? The victory of user-activated resistance established precedent: Bitcoin governance favors the status quo, and changing the rules requires overwhelming consensus—not corporate lobbying.

## Key Ideas

### On Governance & Decentralization

**"If we cannot resolve this dispute now, when only a few hundred people really care about it, what hope does Bitcoin really have?"** (Page reference: Discussion of scaling debates)
- Context: Realizing that Bitcoin must be robust against immense pressure from major economic and political players as it grows.

**"I began to realize that the rules of the network had to be robust. It had to be really difficult to change the rules, otherwise it would not stand up to the pressure from the main financial establishment, which would surely emerge as the value of the system increased."**
- The key insight: status quo bias is a feature, not a bug.

**"The status quo had to be defined somehow. There had to be dynamics in place to ensure the status quo would survive and prevail."**
- Bitcoin's governance philosophy: inertia protects decentralization.

**"Control of software repository, of course, does not mean control over Bitcoin. Bitcoin users can run any software they like, from any repository they like."** (Post-Satoshi transition discussion)
- Fundamental misunderstanding by large blockers about where power resides.

### On Mining vs. User Sovereignty

**"Miners had said that they have real businesses, they invested real money and they produce the blocks, giving them real power over the network, while the developers had no such influence."** (Hong Kong conference)
- The miner misconception that would be proven wrong.

**"Proof of work was there to solve the double spending problem, they contended; miners merely decide on the order of transactions."** (Small blocker argument)
- Mining is for transaction ordering, not governance.

**"Each side was correct, in a way. If Bitcoin XT reached the 75 percent threshold and then everyone upgraded to the larger block limits, the miners would be in control. If users refused to upgrade, miners would not be in control."**
- The fundamental tension that UASF resolved.

### On Corporate Capture Attempts

**"It is imperative that we plan for success by raising the maximum block size. BIP 101 and 8MB blocks are supported by a majority of the community and we feel it is time for the industry to unite behind this proposal."** (Letter from BitPay, Blockchain.info, Circle, Coinbase, Xapo, BitGo CEOs)
- The opening salvo: venture-backed companies claiming to speak for "the community."

**"The biggest risk to bitcoin right now is, ironically, one of the things that has helped it the most in the past: the bitcoin core developers."** (Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO)
- Corporate frustration with developers who wouldn't compromise Bitcoin's security properties.

**"Luckily, bitcoin has a built in upgrade mechanism with an elegant design. If a majority of bitcoin miners 'vote' for a particular upgrade then by definition this is the new version of bitcoin."** (Brian Armstrong)
- Fundamental misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works.

### On User-Activated Resistance

**"The proposal removed the limit and replaced it with something else, thereby negating the argument. However, SegWit was exceptionally complicated and almost nobody understood it."**
- The technical elegance that confounded the opposition.

**"Difficult to appreciate it now, but Bitcoin came reasonably close to a catastrophic failure."** (Introduction)
- The stakes were existential.

### On Censorship & Forum Moderation

**"If one couldn't campaign for a change due to a lack of consensus, then how would we ever reach consensus? It was a catch-22 situation!"**
- The apparent paradox of maintaining status quo while allowing change debate.

**"They were typically anarcho-capitalists or libertarians, who strongly supported free speech. Bitcoiners typically felt their voice was ignored when expressing opposition to these policies, or deemed irrelevant. This is why many became Bitcoiners in the first place; they felt that this time it's our money, not theirs! This time our voice will count!"**
- Why censorship accusations were so explosive in this community.

### On Time Preferences & Strategic Vision

**"To the smaller blockers, Bitcoin was not a business, nor a payment system taking on VISA, Paypal and Mastercard. The main priority, which was a robust and new form of money."**
- The fundamental divergence in vision.

**"If Bitcoin gains traction, these payment services can simply lower fees and speed up transaction times. The reason these centralised payment systems had not done this was a lack of competition and some admin-related legal issues, which could be overcome. In contrast, becoming a new form of money, capable of unblockable electronic transactions, was something the traditional financial establishment would be unable to compete with."**
- Why competing on payments was strategically naive.

**"The fast and cheap payments network idea would not result in a model with a sustainable competitive advantage. The only way to effectively have both, they argued, was with a layer-two solution such as lightning."**
- Layer-two as the only viable scaling path.

### On Satoshi & Appeals to Authority

**"Bitcoin is not a religion and Satoshi is not a prophet. We probably know much more about Bitcoin than Satoshi back then, due to the experience of seeing the network in action."**
- Rejecting appeals to Satoshi's authority.

**"I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep."** (Satoshi, June 2010)
- Satoshi's warning about competing implementations.

### On Technical Complexity & Misunderstanding

**"SegWit was exceptionally complicated and almost nobody understood it. It had a deeply cryptic and confusing name, which sounded highly suspicious to the large blockers."**
- How technical excellence became a political liability.

**"Even Jeff Garzik didn't seem to understand it."**
- The depth of confusion, even among developers.

## Main Concepts

### The Blocksize Debate Explained Simply

**The Basic Question:** Should Bitcoin increase the 1MB block size limit to allow more transactions per block?

**Large Blocker Position:**
- 1MB is too small and prevents Bitcoin from scaling
- Bigger blocks = more transactions = cheaper fees = mass adoption
- Restriction is artificial and can be easily changed
- Companies need predictable low fees to build businesses
- Time preference: grow now, optimize later

**Small Blocker Position:**
- Bigger blocks = higher cost to run a node = fewer users can verify rules
- Fewer nodes = centralization = Bitcoin becomes controllable
- Must preserve ability for ordinary users to run full nodes
- Time preference: establish robust base layer first, scale on layer-two
- Changing rules should be exceptionally difficult

### Why Users Running Nodes Won the War

**The Power Structure:**
1. **Miners** produce blocks and order transactions (solve double-spend)
2. **Developers** write code and propose changes
3. **Users running nodes** enforce the rules by rejecting invalid blocks
4. **Exchanges/Businesses** provide infrastructure and liquidity

**The Critical Insight:** Miners don't control Bitcoin's rules—they only decide transaction order. Full nodes decide what constitutes a valid block. If miners produce blocks that violate the rules enforced by user nodes, those blocks are rejected, and miners waste electricity.

**How It Played Out:**
- Large blockers assumed miner signaling = miner control
- They designed activation at 75% miner threshold
- Small blockers understood users could reject even the longest chain
- UASF (User-Activated Soft Fork) proved users could force miners' hands
- Economic nodes (exchanges, businesses running nodes) sided with small blocks
- Miners followed economic incentives and abandoned large block proposals

### User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) as Resistance to Capture

**What is UASF?**
A mechanism where users running full nodes activate a protocol upgrade on a specific date, regardless of miner signaling. If miners don't comply, their blocks are rejected by user nodes.

**Why It Mattered:**
- Reversed the power dynamic: users forced miners to comply
- Proved that economic nodes (exchanges, merchants) determine Bitcoin, not hashpower
- Demonstrated genuine decentralization: grassroots resistance worked
- Established precedent: protocol changes require user consent, not corporate backing

**The Mechanism:**
- Set flag day: SegWit activates on date X
- Users run UASF nodes that reject non-SegWit-signaling blocks after date X
- Miners face choice: signal SegWit or have blocks rejected by economic nodes
- Economic pressure (exchanges running UASF nodes) forces miner compliance

### Via Negativa Connection: What Bitcoin Governance Is NOT

**Bitcoin Governance is NOT:**
- Developer control (they write code, but can't force adoption)
- Miner control (they order transactions, but can't change rules)
- Corporate control (they can lobby, but can't override users)
- Democracy (no voting mechanism that determines protocol rules)
- Dictatorship (no central authority can mandate changes)
- Meritocracy alone (technical merit necessary but insufficient for consensus)

**Bitcoin Governance IS:**
- Extremely high coordination costs for rule changes
- Default to status quo unless overwhelming consensus emerges
- Power of saying "no" distributed among all node operators
- Adversarial security model: assume bad actors, design accordingly
- Antifragile through difficulty of change

**The Via Negativa Lesson:** Bitcoin's strength comes from what it resists (capture, inflation, control) rather than what it enables. Governance works by making bad changes nearly impossible, not by efficiently implementing good changes.

## Discussion Questions

### 1. How Should Bitcoin Make Decisions?

**Explore:**
- Is "rough consensus" sufficient, or does Bitcoin need more formal governance?
- Should technical merit alone determine protocol changes?
- How do we balance efficiency (ability to upgrade) with security (resistance to capture)?
- Is gridlock a bug or a feature?
- What role should economic actors (businesses, exchanges) play versus technical contributors (developers) versus users?

**Consider:** The Blocksize War proved that Bitcoin's lack of formal governance structures is actually a feature—it raises the cost of rule changes so high that only changes with near-universal support can pass. Would a formal voting system have made Bitcoin more vulnerable to corporate capture?

### 2. Why Do Small Blocks Matter for Decentralization?

**Explore:**
- What is the relationship between block size, node operation costs, and number of nodes?
- If only large companies can afford to run nodes, how does that affect Bitcoin's trust model?
- Is "Don't Trust, Verify" meaningful if verification requires a data center?
- What are the trade-offs between transactional capacity and decentralization?

**Thought Experiment:** If blocks were 1GB, requiring enterprise-grade infrastructure to run a node, would Bitcoin still be meaningfully different from the traditional financial system? What would be lost?

### 3. Lessons from the Blocksize Wars for Other Protocols

**Explore:**
- What made Bitcoin resistant to capture that other protocols might lack?
- How did Ethereum's governance (successful hard fork for The DAO hack) differ from Bitcoin's?
- Are there scenarios where "move fast and break things" is appropriate for protocols?
- What does this teach us about the difference between products (can iterate quickly) and protocols (must be stable)?

**Consider:** Many newer cryptocurrencies prioritize transaction speed and low fees over decentralization. Have they learned the wrong lessons from the Blocksize Wars?

### 4. Corporate Capture vs. Grassroots Resistance: Can It Happen Again?

**Explore:**
- What made the grassroots resistance successful? (Technical knowledge, UASF coordination, economic node support)
- Are the same conditions present today, or has Bitcoin's ecosystem changed?
- What role did social media, forums, and information warfare play?
- Would moderation policies that seemed like "censorship" still work today?

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**
- Calls for "pragmatic compromise" on fundamental security properties
- Corporate coalitions claiming to represent "the community"
- Simplistic framing (big blocks good, small blocks bad)
- Impatience with consensus-building processes

### 5. Running a Node: Symbolic or Substantive?

**Explore:**
- If you run a non-mining node, what power do you actually have?
- Your node rejects invalid blocks, but if you're not economically significant, does it matter?
- Is running a node about personal sovereignty (verifying your own transactions) or network sovereignty (contributing to decentralization)?
- What's the minimum viable number of nodes for meaningful decentralization?

**The Paradox:** Every individual node is economically negligible, yet the aggregate of user nodes determines Bitcoin. How do we think about individual contribution to a collective defense system?

### 6. Time Preferences: Grow Now or Secure First?

**Explore:**
- Large blockers prioritized merchant adoption and user growth; small blockers prioritized security and decentralization. Who was right?
- Can Bitcoin afford to be slow and expensive during its growth phase?
- Is "perfect being the enemy of good" applicable here, or was the "good" actually inadequate?
- Could Lightning Network have emerged without the fee pressure created by small blocks?

### 7. What If Large Blockers Had Won?

**Counterfactual Scenario:**
- Bitcoin Classic activates at 75% miner threshold in 2016
- Blocks increase to 2MB, then continue growing
- Running a node becomes progressively more expensive
- Only businesses and serious enthusiasts maintain full nodes

**Questions:**
- Would Bitcoin still be credibly decentralized?
- Would nation-state resistance be viable?
- Would Lightning Network have developed?
- Would Bitcoin's value proposition be fundamentally different?

## Integration with 90-Minute Curriculum

### Fits Into "Don't Trust, Verify" Segment (30 minutes)

**The Blocksize Wars as Case Study:**

**Minute 0-10: The Stakes**
- Introduce the war: 2015-2017, corporate-backed big blockers vs. grassroots small blockers
- Central question: Who controls Bitcoin's rules?
- Outcome: User nodes won, establishing precedent for decentralization

**Minute 10-20: How "Verify" Works in Practice**
- Explain full node vs. mining node distinction
- Your node enforces rules by rejecting invalid blocks
- Network security depends on distributed rule enforcement
- If you don't run a node, you trust someone else's verification
- Blocksize limits exist to keep verification accessible

**Minute 20-30: Why Running a Node Matters**
- Individual sovereignty: verify your own transactions, no trusted third parties
- Collective sovereignty: contribute to network's resistance to rule changes
- Economic nodes (exchanges, merchants) amplify user resistance
- UASF case study: users forced miners to activate SegWit
- Action item: Run your own node (Bitcoin Core, Umbrel, RaspiBlitz, Start9)

**Discussion Bridge:**
"The Blocksize War proved that Bitcoin's security model only works if users can actually verify the rules. Small blocks aren't a technical limitation—they're a conscious choice to preserve the ability to 'Don't Trust, Verify.' When blocks grow too large, verification becomes expensive, and we're back to trusting intermediaries."

### Connection to Broader Curriculum Themes

**Book 1 (Genesis Book): Cypherpunk Ethos**
- Blocksize War tested whether Bitcoin could resist corporate co-optation
- Cypherpunks build systems that don't require trusting authorities
- Large blockers wanted efficiency; small blockers wanted trustlessness

**Book 2 (Mastering Bitcoin): Technical Foundations**
- Understanding how nodes validate blocks is essential to understanding the war
- SegWit's technical elegance (fixing malleability, enabling Lightning) vindicated patient development
- Trade-offs between on-chain scaling and layer-two solutions

**Book 3 (The Bitcoin Standard): Monetary Properties**
- Sound money requires unchangeable supply cap
- If Bitcoin's rules are easy to change, supply cap is vulnerable
- Blocksize War established that Bitcoin's monetary policy is genuinely credible

**Book 4 (Layered Money): Scaling Through Layers**
- Lightning Network emerged as the scaling solution
- Layer-one for settlement, layer-two for payments
- Same model as historical gold (base layer) and bank notes (scaling layer)

**Book 5 (Parallel Systems): Building Alternatives**
- Rather than fight for political control of Bitcoin, build on it
- Lightning Network, sidechains, and applications assume base layer stability
- Innovation happens at edges, not through protocol governance fights

---

## Connection to Other Books

### Pairs with Mastering Bitcoin (Technical Governance)

**How They Complement:**
- Mastering Bitcoin explains HOW Bitcoin works technically
- Blocksize Wars explains WHY certain technical choices matter politically
- SegWit: technical implementation (Mastering Bitcoin) vs. political battle (Blocksize Wars)
- Node validation: technical process (Mastering Bitcoin) vs. governance power (Blocksize Wars)

**Discussion Integration:**
"After reading Mastering Bitcoin's chapters on nodes and consensus, the Blocksize War shows why those technical details have profound political implications. The ability to run a node isn't just a feature—it's the foundation of Bitcoin's resistance to capture."

### Links to The Genesis Book (Cypherpunk Ethos vs. Corporate Control)

**Thematic Connections:**
- Genesis Book: cypherpunks build systems that don't require trust
- Blocksize Wars: testing whether Bitcoin truly doesn't require trust
- Genesis Book: resistance to government financial surveillance
- Blocksize Wars: resistance to corporate control of protocol

**The Evolution:**
- 1990s: Cypherpunks vs. Government (crypto wars, remailers)
- 2010s: Bitcoiners vs. Corporations (blocksize wars)
- Common thread: defend systems that resist centralized control

**Discussion Point:**
"The cypherpunks profiled in The Genesis Book built Bitcoin to resist government control. The Blocksize War proved it could also resist corporate control. Same ethos, different adversary. The question is whether the cultural memory of this resistance persists as Bitcoin grows."

### Complements Parallel Systems (Building Alternative vs. Fighting)

**The Contrast:**
- Parallel Systems: build alternatives, don't fight for control of existing institutions
- Blocksize Wars: Bitcoin community fought over control of protocol
- Resolution: layer-two development (Lightning) as parallel system on top of base layer

**The Synthesis:**
- Defending Bitcoin's base layer stability enables parallel systems to build on it
- Lightning Network, Liquid, RGB: all assume base layer won't change under them
- Fighting for protocol stability creates platform for peaceful innovation

**Discussion Point:**
"The Blocksize War seems to contradict Parallel Systems' 'don't fight, build' ethos. But the resolution was actually perfectly aligned: small blockers defended base layer stability, then large blockers who cared about scaling could build Lightning Network without fighting over protocol changes. The fight was necessary to establish the stable foundation for parallel systems."

### Relates to The Bitcoin Standard (Credible Commitment)

**Key Insight:**
- Bitcoin Standard: Bitcoin succeeds as money because supply cap is credible
- Blocksize Wars: proving that rules are genuinely difficult to change
- Connection: if blocksize could be easily changed by corporate pressure, supply cap could too

**Discussion:**
"The Bitcoin Standard argues Bitcoin's fixed supply makes it superior money. But that only matters if the rule is genuinely unchangeable. The Blocksize War was the trial by fire. If 21 million coins can only change with the same level of consensus required to change 1MB blocks, the supply cap is credibly secure."

### Informs Layered Money (Scaling Through Layers)

**The Architecture:**
- Layered Money: gold (base layer) -> bank notes (scaling layer)
- Bitcoin: base layer (1MB blocks, settlement) -> Lightning (scaling layer, payments)

**Historical Parallel:**
- You can't make gold transactions faster by changing gold's properties
- You build payment systems on top of gold settlement
- Same with Bitcoin: can't make base layer scale infinitely without breaking security
- Build Lightning on top of secure settlement layer

**Discussion:**
"Layered Money shows that monetary systems have always scaled through layers, not by modifying the base layer. The Blocksize War was essentially fighting over whether Bitcoin should follow this historical pattern or try something new. Small blockers won, and Lightning Network vindicated the layered approach."

**Exercise:**
- Choose one BIP from the Blocksize War era
- Understand the technical proposal
- Understand the political context
- Consider: why did some BIPs activate and others fail?

### 4. Explore Lightning Network (The Scaling Solution That Worked)

**Why Lightning Matters:**
- Vindication of small block strategy: scale on layer-two, not layer-one
- Enables instant, cheap payments without changing Bitcoin's base layer
- Demonstrates that blocksize constraint drove innovation

**Get Started:**
- **Learn:** Lightning Network whitepaper (simplified version at lightning.network)
- **Use:** Set up a Lightning wallet (Phoenix, Breez, Muun)
- **Experience:** Make a Lightning payment (buy coffee at a BTC-accepting cafe, tip a creator)
- **Run:** Set up Lightning node (after running Bitcoin full node)

**Resources:**
- LNBook (Lightning Network reference): github.com/lnbook/lnbook
- Lightning Labs' resources: lightning.engineering/resources
- Mastering the Lightning Network (book)
- Bitcoin Optech Lightning topics

**Reflection Questions:**
- How does Lightning preserve Bitcoin's base layer security?
- What trade-offs does Lightning make (trust model, liquidity, UX)?
- Could Lightning have developed if blocks were 1GB?
- What role did fee pressure (small blocks) play in Lightning adoption?

### 5. Study Protocol Governance Case Studies

**Compare Bitcoin's Blocksize War to:**
- **Ethereum's DAO Hard Fork** (2016): Different governance outcome
- **Bitcoin Cash Split** (2017): The large blockers who left
- **Ethereum's EIP-1559** (2021): Fee market redesign
- **Taproot Activation** (2021): Post-war consensus process

**Questions to Explore:**
- What made Bitcoin resistant to contentious hard forks?
- Why did Ethereum successfully hard fork for The DAO?
- Is either approach "better," or are they suited to different goals?
- How do different cryptocurrencies' governance cultures compare?

### 6. Develop an Adversarial Mindset

**What This Means:**
- Assume powerful actors will try to capture or attack Bitcoin
- Design evaluation: does this change make Bitcoin more or less resistant?
- Question motives: who benefits from this proposed change?
- Default to skepticism of "efficient" governance

**Practice:**
- When evaluating Bitcoin proposals, ask: "How could this be abused?"
- Consider second-order effects: "If this passes, what's the next logical ask?"
- Threat model: "If I were trying to undermine Bitcoin, would this change help me?"

**Historical Literacy:**
- Study how previous monetary systems were captured (gold standard abandonment, Bretton Woods collapse)
- Learn about corporate capture of regulatory agencies
- Understand how gradual compromises lead to total capture

**Application:**
"The Blocksize War teaches us that good intentions (scaling Bitcoin for mass adoption) can lead to bad outcomes (centralization, vulnerability to capture). The adversarial mindset isn't about paranoia—it's about taking security seriously in an adversarial world."

### 7. Engage with Primary Sources

**Read Historical Artifacts:**
- BitcoinTalk forum threads from 2015-2017
- Original Reddit debates (r/Bitcoin vs. r/btc archives)
- Developer mailing list discussions
- Company blog posts (Coinbase, BitPay positions)
- Gregory Maxwell's technical writings

**Why Primary Sources Matter:**
- See how arguments evolved in real time
- Understand the fog of war (what was known vs. uncertain)
- Appreciate the intensity and emotional stakes
- Develop critical thinking: evaluate arguments on merit

**Warning:** Historical sources can be overwhelming and acrimonious. Read with the benefit of hindsight: who was right? What patterns emerged?

### 8. Connect to Current Issues

**Apply Blocksize War Lessons to Today:**

**Current Debates:**
- Taproot activation mechanics (2021): How did post-war consensus work?
- CTV/APO covenant proposals: How should Bitcoin add new features?
- Mining centralization concerns: Have the risks changed?
- Regulation and mining: Can governments control Bitcoin through miners?

**Questions:**
- Are the cultural antibodies from the Blocksize War still active?
- Has Bitcoin's ecosystem changed in ways that affect governance?
- What new threats exist that weren't present in 2015-2017?
- Are we prepared for nation-state-level pressure?

**Reflection:**
"The Blocksize War was Bitcoin's tutorial level for resisting capture. The real game is defending against nation-states and central banks. Are the lessons from 2015-2017 sufficient, or do we need to evolve our governance immune system?"

---

## Conclusion: The War's Enduring Lessons

The Blocksize War wasn't just a historical event—it was a defining moment that established Bitcoin's governance culture. The lessons:

1. **Status quo is powerful:** Changing Bitcoin's rules requires overwhelming consensus, not corporate pressure.
2. **Users control the rules:** Node operators, not miners or developers, have final say.
3. **Technical complexity matters:** Security properties can't be sacrificed for user experience.
4. **Time preference wisdom:** Building robust foundations enables later innovation.
5. **Resistance is possible:** Grassroots coordination can defeat well-funded corporate coalitions.

These principles didn't exist in the abstract—they were forged in conflict, tested in battle, and proven in victory. Understanding this history is essential for anyone who wants to understand not just how Bitcoin works, but why it's resilient.

**Final Discussion Prompt:**
"Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others." (Churchill)

Bitcoin governance is the worst form of protocol governance, except for all the others. Its inefficiency, gridlock, and difficulty of change aren't bugs—they're features that prevent capture. The Blocksize War proved it works. Now we maintain vigilance.
