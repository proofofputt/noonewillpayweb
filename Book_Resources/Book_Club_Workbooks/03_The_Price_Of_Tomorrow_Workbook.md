# The Price Of Tomorrow - Book Club Discussion Workbook

## Book Overview

**Author:** Jeff Booth
**Publication Year:** 2020
**Core Thesis:** Technology is inherently deflationary - it naturally drives prices down and creates abundance. However, our monetary system is built on inflation, creating a fundamental conflict. Central banks fight deflation by printing money and creating debt, but this only delays the inevitable reckoning. The solution is to embrace deflation and allow technology to deliver the abundant future it promises.

**Why This Book Matters:**
This book reveals the hidden war between two opposing forces: deflationary technology (which makes things cheaper and better) versus inflationary money (which makes things more expensive). Understanding this conflict is essential to comprehending why wealth inequality grows, why economic anxiety increases despite technological progress, and why Bitcoin represents a paradigm shift toward sound money that enables abundance.

## Key Ideas

### Technology & Deflation
- "Technology is a deflationary force so great that, in the end, nothing we do will stop it."
- "Deflation, put simply, is when you get more for your money just as inflation is when you get less for your money."
- "We continue to get more for less."
- "Information doesn't have the same constraints that physical goods have: it travels seamlessly across borders. It is much more efficient, eradicating a lot of waste from the system. But much of that waste and inefficiency are our jobs."

### The Debt Problem
- "In other words, it has taken approximately $185 trillion of global debt to achieve $46 trillion of global growth."
- "The mirage of growth today is nothing more than a debt fuelled spending binge."
- "Debt combined deflation is a toxic combination, because borrowers have to pay the same for their interest payments while earning less."
- "There is already too much debt in the world, which paradoxically makes the problem harder to solve."

### Central Banks & Money Manipulation
- As Keynes wrote: "Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens."
- "A country that devalues its currency also indirectly lowers its labour rate against global competitors, which can help some job growth in the short term, because its goods cost less to buyers in other countries."
- "The endless game of reducing the value of currencies relative to others only serves as a short-term panacea, because asset prices will rise far more quickly than jobs can be created."

### The Exponential Nature of Technology
- "Beyond just the doubling of computing power, we should expect a 40 percent annual decline in price to performance."
- "The cost of one megabyte of hard drive memory has fallen from approximately $1 million in 1967 to 2 cents today."
- "In less than two hours, more energy from the sun hits the Earth than the yearly worldwide consumption of energy."
- "Levelized cost of utility-grade solar dropped 88 percent in the last ten years."

### Abundance Through Scarcity (Bitcoin)
- "Bitcoin attempts to change that dynamic by forever fixing supply at twenty one million Bitcoins."
- "It creates a peer-to-peer ledger without any central control: the blockchain. As an open, distributed ledger, it offers security and trust by verifying transactions with consensus instead of through a central authority."
- "Some parts of the world have less risk in holding Bitcoin than their own currency."

### The Simple Solution
- "Deflation becomes something celebrated because it means that we are getting more for less."
- "As technology removes jobs and fewer overall jobs are needed, prices will keep falling, allowing those who lose jobs a way to share in the benefit of technology abundance without massive transfers of wealth."
- "The deflationary aspect of technology is too great a force and it will eventually overwhelm even the greatest efforts to stop it."

### Wealth Inequality & Social Unrest
- "The seemingly random events of Brexit, Trump, and a rise in populism and hate in our world are not haphazard or isolated at all. They are all connected to a loss in hope for a better future for large portions of the population."
- "The world naturally becomes more unsafe when large amounts of people with increasing anxiety about their own economic future see incredible wealth creation in hands of very few people."
- "People do not naturally hate others when they're content or have abundance. They are manipulated into it when they feel discounted or that they have nothing to lose."

### Call to Action
- "Something must be done. But because the issues are so complex and thorny in nature, it is easy to put heads in the sand and hope others will solve them."
- "It is not reasonable to believe that what will work in the future should necessarily be built on what worked in the past."
- "The opportunity to create something better comes from observing something broken or that doesn't work the way you believe it should."

## Main Concepts

### The Technology-Money Conflict
**In Simple Terms:** Every time technology improves, it should make things cheaper. Your smartphone can do what used to require hundreds of devices - it's a camera, calculator, GPS, music player, encyclopedia, and more. This should mean you spend less money overall. But instead, everything keeps getting more expensive. Why?

The answer is **inflation** - central banks print money to create the illusion of growth, which makes each dollar worth less. So even though technology makes products cheaper to produce, inflation makes them more expensive to buy.

This is Via Negativa in action - the problem isn't that we need MORE (more money, more jobs, more growth). The problem is we need to REMOVE the broken money system that prevents technology's natural abundance from reaching people. Technology wants to give us abundance for free.

### The Debt Trap
**In Simple Terms:** Governments and central banks try to fight deflation by creating debt - borrowing from the future to spend today. It's like using a credit card to pay for another credit card. Eventually, the system collapses under its own weight.

The key insight: **$185 trillion in global debt has only produced $46 trillion in growth**. That's a 4:1 ratio of debt to growth - completely unsustainable.

**Via Negativa Connection:** Rather than adding more debt, more stimulus, more intervention, we need to remove the debt-based monetary system entirely and embrace deflationary abundance.

### Exponential Technology Growth
**In Simple Terms:** Technology doesn't grow in a straight line - it grows exponentially (doubles repeatedly). This is hard for our brains to understand. The famous example: Would you rather have $1 million today or a penny that doubles every day for 31 days? The penny becomes $10.7 million.

This exponential growth means:
- Computing power doubles every 18-24 months
- Solar energy costs drop 75% every 10 years
- AI capabilities increase at accelerating rates
- 3D printing, VR/AR, autonomous vehicles - all following exponential curves

**The Implication:** The deflationary force of technology will become unstoppable, overwhelming any attempt to inflate our way out.

### Platform Monopolies & Network Effects
**In Simple Terms:** Companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook become more valuable as more people use them. This creates a feedback loop where the winner takes all. These new monopolies are different from old ones because they make things CHEAPER and BETTER for consumers, not more expensive.

**The Paradox:** Technology platforms aggregate supply to give consumers infinite choice at falling prices - but this concentrates wealth and power in fewer hands, driving inequality.

### Energy as the Foundation
**In Simple Terms:** Energy is the foundation of all economic activity. As solar energy becomes cheaper than fossil fuels (which is already happening), it will:
- Make electricity nearly free
- Enable clean water through desalination
- Reverse carbon emissions
- Transform transportation via EVs
- Decentralize power generation

**The Deflationary Impact:** Cheap energy makes everything else cheaper - manufacturing, transportation, food production, water purification. This abundance should make everyone richer, but our money system prevents this.

### Artificial Intelligence & Job Displacement
**In Simple Terms:** AI isn't just automation - it's pattern recognition at superhuman scale. Computers can now:
- Play billions of game simulations to learn optimal strategies
- Diagnose diseases better than doctors
- Drive cars safer than humans
- Write code, create art, make decisions

**The Reality:** Most jobs are pattern recognition - and AI is better at it. This doesn't mean we'll have nothing to do; it means we need a system that allows people to benefit from abundance even without traditional jobs.

### The Four "Solutions" (All Flawed)
1. **Austerity** - Cutting spending (causes collapse)
2. **Debt default** - Restructuring debt (wipes out wealth too fast)
3. **Print money** - QE, MMT (delays problem, creates inequality)
4. **Wealth transfers** - UBI, higher taxes (creates division, doesn't address root cause)

**The Real Solution:** Accept deflation, embrace abundance, and use sound money (Bitcoin) that can't be manipulated.

### Bitcoin as the Escape Hatch
**In Simple Terms:** Bitcoin is money that can't be inflated away. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins - no central bank can print more. This creates digital scarcity in a world of abundance.

**The Key Insight:** We need scarcity in money (to preserve value) and abundance in goods/services (enabled by technology). Current system gives us the opposite - abundant money (inflation) that fights against abundant goods (deflation).

## Discussion Questions

### Question 1: The Smartphone Paradox
**Discussion Starter:** Your smartphone has the computing power that would have cost millions of dollars 30 years ago. It replaces hundreds of devices. Why hasn't this technological abundance made your life significantly cheaper? Where does the deflation "go"?

**Key Points to Explore:**
- How inflation hides technological deflation
- Asset price inflation vs. consumer price inflation
- Why wages can't keep up with asset prices

### Question 2: The Moral Case for Deflation
**Discussion Starter:** We're taught that deflation is "bad" and inflation is "good" (or at least necessary). But deflation means you can buy more with your money over time - isn't that abundance? Why do central banks fight it so aggressively?

**Key Points to Explore:**
- Whose interests does inflation serve?
- The debt trap and why inflation is needed to service it
- What abundance would look like if we accepted deflation

### Question 3: Creative Destruction vs. Job Preservation
**Discussion Starter:** Technology creates abundance by eliminating jobs (efficiency). Our economic system requires job growth to function. This is a fundamental conflict. Do we:
- Fight technology to preserve jobs (and miss abundance)?
- Embrace technology and redesign our economic system?
- Try to have both (current approach - and it's failing)?

**Key Points to Explore:**
- Why "new jobs will be created" may not be true this time
- The difference between past industrial revolutions and AI/automation
- What humans would do in a world of abundance without traditional jobs

### Question 4: Sound Money as Infrastructure
**Discussion Starter:** We accept that the internet should be neutral infrastructure (no one controls it). Why don't we demand the same for money? What if money was infrastructure that no government or central bank could manipulate?

**Key Points to Explore:**
- The difference between Bitcoin and fiat currency
- Why money manipulation benefits some at the expense of others
- How sound money enables technology's deflationary abundance

### Question 5: The Inequality Trap
**Discussion Starter:** Technology creates abundance (more for less) but our current system creates inequality (few winners, many losers). Is this because of technology itself, or because of how our monetary system responds to technology?

**Key Points to Explore:**
- How money printing drives asset prices up faster than wages
- Why the wealthy benefit more from inflation than the poor
- How deflationary money could distribute abundance more fairly

### Question 6: The Energy Revolution
**Discussion Starter:** Solar energy is becoming cheaper than fossil fuels. In a sane economic system, this would make everything cheaper (since energy is the foundation of all production). Why isn't that happening? What's blocking the abundance?

**Key Points to Explore:**
- How cheap energy should transform the economy
- Why vested interests fight deflation even when it means abundance
- The connection between energy abundance and economic freedom

### Question 7: International Coordination
**Discussion Starter:** Booth argues we need coordinated international action to transition to deflationary money. But game theory suggests countries will "cheat" by devaluing their currency. How do we escape this prisoners' dilemma?

**Key Points to Explore:**
- Why individual countries can't act alone
- How Bitcoin could become the coordination mechanism
- Whether abundance reduces the incentive to cheat

## Integration with 90-Minute Curriculum

### Fits Into: "Broader Implications" Segment (Final 30 Minutes)

**Bridge from Bitcoin Basics:**
The first 60 minutes establish WHAT Bitcoin is and HOW it works. The Price of Tomorrow explains WHY Bitcoin matters for human flourishing - it's the monetary system that enables technology's abundant future.

**Key Teaching Points:**

1. **The Setup (5 minutes):**
   - Technology should make everything cheaper (Moore's Law, exponential growth)
   - But prices keep rising (inflation)
   - This creates anxiety, inequality, and social division

2. **The Problem (10 minutes):**
   - Our monetary system is built on inflation and debt
   - Central banks must fight deflation to keep the debt system alive
   - This prevents technology from delivering abundance
   - $185 trillion in debt for $46 trillion in growth - unsustainable

3. **The Solution (10 minutes):**
   - Accept deflation as abundance, not danger
   - Use sound money (Bitcoin) that can't be inflated
   - Allow technology to make things cheaper without monetary interference
   - This enables everyone to benefit from technological progress

4. **The Call to Action (5 minutes):**
   - Understanding this conflict is essential for the future
   - Bitcoin isn't just an investment - it's infrastructure for an abundant future
   - The transition must happen before social unrest forces a violent reset

**Connection to Other Curriculum Elements:**
- **Technical Foundation:** Bitcoin's fixed supply (21M) is the technical feature that enables this economic transformation
- **Security Model:** Sound money requires security - this is why proof-of-work matters
- **Network Effects:** As more people adopt Bitcoin, it becomes the global coordination mechanism for escaping the debt trap

---

## Connection to Other Books

### Perfect Pairing: The Bitcoin Standard (Saifedean Ammous)
**Synergy:** Both books argue for sound money, but from different angles:
- **The Bitcoin Standard:** Historical analysis of money, why Bitcoin is superior sound money
- **The Price of Tomorrow:** Technology perspective, why we NEED sound money to enable abundance

**Discussion Link:** "The Bitcoin Standard shows you Bitcoin is sound money. The Price of Tomorrow shows you why that matters for human civilization."

---

### Complementary: Taming the Sun (Varun Sivaram)
**Connection:** Both explore energy transformation:
- **Taming the Sun:** Deep dive into solar technology and policy
- **The Price of Tomorrow:** Solar as example of deflationary technology abundance

**Discussion Link:** "Sivaram shows how solar technology works. Booth shows why cheap solar threatens the inflation-dependent system and how Bitcoin enables the transition."

---

### Thematic Link: The Sovereign Individual (Davidson & Rees-Mogg)
**Parallel:** Both predict transformation driven by technology:
- **The Sovereign Individual:** Information age empowers individuals over nation-states
- **The Price of Tomorrow:** Technology creates abundance if we choose sound money

**Discussion Link:** "Davidson predicted the individual would become sovereign. Booth shows that sovereignty requires sound money to capture technology's abundance."

---

### Foundation Text: The Creature from Jekyll Island (G. Edward Griffin)
**Historical Context:**
- **Jekyll Island:** How central banking was created to enable money manipulation
- **The Price of Tomorrow:** Why that system fails in an age of exponential technology

**Discussion Link:** "Griffin exposed the central banking system. Booth shows why it's incompatible with technological abundance - and how Bitcoin fixes it."

---

### Via Negativa Philosophy: Antifragile (Nassim Nicholas Taleb)
**Philosophical Alignment:** Both advocate for removing fragility:
- **Antifragile:** "Small forest fires periodically cleanse the system" (Booth quotes this, p. 196)
- **The Price of Tomorrow:** Remove monetary manipulation, embrace natural deflation

**Discussion Link:** "Taleb teaches us to remove fragility by allowing natural processes. Booth applies this to money - stop preventing deflation, let technology deliver abundance."

## Closing Reflection

### The Book Club Synthesis

The Price of Tomorrow reveals the core truth: **abundance through scarcity**.

- **Scarcity in money** (Bitcoin's fixed supply) enables **abundance in goods** (technology's deflation)
- **Removing** monetary manipulation allows technology to deliver prosperity
- **Via Negativa** applied to economics: the solution isn't MORE (stimulus, jobs, growth), it's LESS (interference, manipulation, inflation)

Technology wants to make everything free or nearly free. The only thing preventing this is a monetary system designed for a pre-technology era.

Bitcoin isn't just money. It's the infrastructure that allows human civilization to accept the abundant future that technology promises.

---

### Final Quote for Meditation

> "The deflationary aspect of technology is too great a force and it will eventually overwhelm even the greatest efforts to stop it. Those efforts to stop it, and the second-order consequences that fight to halt deflation, will look insane to future generations because that fight will bring on revolutions and wars that burn the existing system to the ground. Allowing that to happen seems insanely irresponsible, since humanity might forever lose the opportunity to have the kind of social uplift that is possible with technology."
>
> — Jeff Booth, The Price of Tomorrow

**The question isn't WHETHER the abundant future arrives. The question is whether we choose it consciously through sound money, or arrive there through chaos and destruction.**

**Choose wisely. Choose Bitcoin. Choose abundance.**
