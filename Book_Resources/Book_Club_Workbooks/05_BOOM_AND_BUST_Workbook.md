# BOOM AND BUST: A Global History of Financial Bubbles
## Book Club Discussion Workbook

---

## Book Overview

**Title:** Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles
**Authors:** William Quinn & John D. Turner
**Publication Year:** 2020

### Core Thesis
Quinn and Turner analyze financial bubbles throughout history using their "Bubble Triangle" framework: bubbles require three elements to form - **marketability** (ease of buying/selling assets), **money and credit** (abundant capital), and **speculation** (momentum trading and "greater fool" mentality). The spark that ignites these elements comes from either technological innovation or government policy.

### Why Understanding Business Cycles Matters for Bitcoin Adoption

Understanding boom-and-bust cycles is critical for Bitcoin adoption because:

1. **Fiat's Structural Weakness:** Central bank manipulation of money supply creates artificial economic cycles that destroy wealth and undermine long-term planning
2. **Bitcoin's Solution:** Fixed supply of 21 million coins prevents monetary manipulation and the malinvestment that characterizes fiat boom-bust cycles
3. **Historical Pattern Recognition:** Every major bubble in history was fueled by abundant money and credit - understanding this pattern reveals why Bitcoin's programmatic scarcity is revolutionary
4. **Long-term Planning:** Bitcoin enables economic calculation and rational capital allocation impossible under perpetual monetary expansion
5. **Escape Velocity:** As more people understand the structural causes of boom-bust cycles, Bitcoin becomes increasingly attractive as an escape from fiat's inherent instability

## Key Ideas

### On Business Cycles

**"Why do stock and housing markets sometimes experience amazing booms followed by massive busts and why is this happening more and more frequently?"**

**"Bubbles can encourage overinvestment, overemployment and overbuilding, which ends up being inefficient for both businesses and society."**

**"We have to turn the page on the bubble-and-bust mentality that created this mess." - President Barack Obama**

### On Central Banking and Money Supply

**"The fuel for the bubble is money and credit. A bubble can form only when the public has sufficient capital to invest in an asset, and is therefore much more likely to occur when there is abundant money and credit in the economy."**

**"Investors would often rather invest in something ridiculous than accept a low interest rate on a safe asset."**

**"M3, a broad measure of the money supply, grew by a total of 141 per cent between 1980 and 1990 [in Japan]; for comparison, between 1990 and 2010, M3 grew by only 40 per cent."**

**"As a result of low interest rates, safe assets were unappealing: in 1987, Japanese treasury bills were yielding only 2.4 per cent, at that time the lowest in their post-war history. Instead, investors piled into land and stocks."**

### On Austrian Economics and Malinvestment

**"Parliamentary procedure had worked well for development of canals and turnpikes, which were all local enterprises, but parliamentarians did not appreciate the importance of network externalities [for railways]."**

**"One study has estimated that the circa 20,000-mile rail system which had emerged by 1914 contained about 7,000 miles more than was necessary - the same social benefits could have been obtained with substantially less investment."**

**"The huge reduction in the time and money costs of travelling made journeys possible for the masses... However, one must ask whether the social usefulness was as high as it could have been had the process of authorising the railways and establishing a railway network not been so laissez-faire or ad hoc."**

### On Speculation and Market Psychology

**"Speculation is the purchase (or sale) of an asset with a view to selling (or repurchasing) the asset at a later date with the sole motivation of generating a capital gain."**

**"Speculators, many of whom trade purely on momentum, buying when prices are rising and selling when prices are falling. May purchase an asset they know to be overpriced, planning to re-sell the asset to 'a greater fool' to make a capital gain. This practice is commonly referred to as 'riding the bubble'."**

**"In J.K. Galbraith's famous history of the crash, he argues that its key feature was that 'all aspects of [stock] ownership became irrelevant except the prospect for an early rise in price.'"**

### On Consequences of Bubbles

**"Estimates, however, conceal the large costs that financial crises have on psychological well-being. They also ignore the human costs associated with the imposition of austerity measures once the crisis is over."**

**"In human terms, this [Great Depression] meant increased homelessness, increased infant mortality and increased rates of suicide. The secondary political effects were even worse, with the Depression a major factor in the collapse of several European democracies and, consequently, World War 2."**

**"The price level in Paris fell by 38 per cent in 1721, a more severe deflation than the United States experienced during Great Depression."**

### On Technology vs. Manipulation

**"Bubbles start when investors and speculators react to new technology or political initiatives, showing that our ability to predict future bubbles will ultimately come down to being able to predict these sparks."**

**"Three ways in which bubbles can be useful: Facilitate innovation, Stimulate future innovations, Provide capital for technological projects that would not be financed to same extent in a fully efficient financial market."**

## Main Concepts

### The Bubble Triangle Framework

Quinn and Turner's core analytical tool consists of three necessary conditions:

1. **Marketability (Oxygen):** The ease with which an asset can be freely bought and sold. Enhanced by:
   - Divisibility (ability to buy small portions)
   - Liquidity (ready buyers and sellers)
   - Standardization and regulation
   - Technological innovation (telegraph, telephone, internet)

2. **Money and Credit (Fuel):** Abundant capital available for investment
   - Central bank monetary expansion
   - Low interest rates forcing "search for yield"
   - Financial innovation (margin lending, securitization)
   - Government debt financing schemes

3. **Speculation (Heat):** Momentum trading and "greater fool" investing
   - Buying solely for capital gains, not fundamentals
   - Short-term flipping and "riding the bubble"
   - Herd behavior and cognitive biases
   - Insider exploitation of retail investors

### The Spark: Technology or Government Policy

Bubbles require an initial catalyst:

- **Technological Innovation:** Railways, bicycles, automobiles, radio, internet
- **Government Policy:** Debt reduction schemes, housing ownership promotion, monetary devaluation, deregulation

### How Central Bank Manipulation Creates Artificial Cycles

The book documents pattern across all major bubbles:

1. **Expansion Phase:**
   - Central bank/government lowers interest rates or expands money supply
   - "Safe assets" become unappealing due to low yields
   - Investors engage in "search for yield" behavior
   - Credit becomes abundant and cheap
   - Asset prices rise beyond fundamental value

2. **Euphoria Phase:**
   - Momentum investors pile in
   - Media becomes cheerleader for continued rises
   - "This time is different" narratives emerge
   - Insider selling begins while retail buying accelerates
   - Leverage increases (margin debt, derivatives)

3. **Crisis Phase:**
   - Some external shock or recognition of overvaluation
   - Margin calls force liquidations
   - Cascade of selling accelerates decline
   - Credit contracts sharply
   - Real economy effects emerge

4. **Depression Phase:**
   - Malinvestments revealed
   - Bankruptcies and defaults cascade
   - Unemployment rises
   - Deflation or severe recession
   - Political and social consequences

### Why Bitcoin's Fixed Supply Prevents Monetary Manipulation

**Programmatic Scarcity:** Bitcoin's 21 million coin limit is enforced by mathematics and distributed consensus, not political discretion.

**Predictable Issuance:** The supply schedule is transparent and unchangeable - approximately every 10 minutes, new bitcoin is created, halving every 210,000 blocks (~4 years).

**No "Search for Yield" Distortion:** Without a central authority manipulating interest rates to zero, capital allocation remains based on genuine productivity and risk assessment.

**Sound Economic Calculation:** Entrepreneurs and businesses can make long-term plans without fear that monetary expansion will render their calculations meaningless.

**No Bailouts:** Bitcoin's code cannot be changed to rescue failed institutions, ensuring genuine market discipline.

**Separates Money from State:** Removes government's ability to fund wars, welfare states, or politically connected industries through inflation.

### Connection to The Bitcoin Standard's Austrian Economics

Both books draw heavily on Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT):

**Ludwig von Mises & Friedrich Hayek:** Artificial credit expansion by central banks sends false signals to entrepreneurs, causing malinvestment in projects that would not be sustainable under genuine savings-driven interest rates.

**Time Preference:** Austrian economics emphasizes that interest rates should reflect society's genuine time preference (preference for present vs. future consumption). Central bank manipulation distorts this critical price signal.

**Calculation Problem:** Without sound money, entrepreneurs cannot accurately calculate economic costs and benefits. Every bubble in Quinn & Turner's book demonstrates this - from the 7,000 miles of excess British railways to the Florida land boom Ponzi schemes.

**Boom Contains Seeds of Bust:** The artificial boom necessarily creates the conditions for the bust. Malinvestment must eventually be liquidated. Resources misallocated during the boom must be reallocated.

**Hard Money Solution:** The Austrian prescription is a return to hard money that cannot be manipulated - exactly what Bitcoin provides through cryptographic proof rather than gold's physical properties.

## Discussion Questions

### Why Do Booms Always Turn to Busts?
- What does the "Bubble Triangle" reveal about the structural nature of bubbles?
- Can you have sustainable growth without the crash if you remove one element of the triangle?
- How does malinvestment during the boom make the bust inevitable?
- What role does leverage play in accelerating both the boom and the bust?

### What Is the True Role of Central Banks in Creating Cycles?
- How did abundant money and credit fuel every bubble in the book?
- Why do low interest rates force a "search for yield" into riskier assets?
- Can central banks successfully manage a bubble, or do they only manage to make it bigger?
- What would happen to boom-bust cycles if central banks couldn't manipulate money supply?

### How Does Bitcoin Change the Boom/Bust Dynamic?
- If Bitcoin were the global reserve currency, could we still have asset bubbles?
- Would the "money and credit" element of the Bubble Triangle be removed under a Bitcoin standard?
- How would fixed supply change entrepreneurial calculation and capital allocation?
- Could technological innovation still create localized bubbles without monetary expansion?

### Is Speculation Inherently Bad or a Natural Market Function?
- How do we distinguish between harmful speculation and productive price discovery?
- What role did insider exploitation play in historical bubbles vs. genuine investor enthusiasm?
- Can markets self-correct without government intervention if we have sound money?
- How did regulatory responses to bubbles (like the 1720 Bubble Act or 1934 Securities Act) affect future market development?

### What Are the Implications for Long-term Planning Under Fiat vs. Bitcoin?
- How does monetary uncertainty affect business investment decisions?
- Why is it impossible to save effectively when central banks target 2% inflation?
- How would retirement planning change under a deflationary/stable currency like Bitcoin?
- What happens to the concept of "financial advice" when money itself is sound?

### Can Bubbles Ever Be Useful for Society?
- The authors suggest some bubbles "facilitated innovation" - is this justification valid?
- Would the railways have been built more efficiently without the Mania?
- Does the "useful bubble" theory justify central bank intervention?
- How do we weigh short-term capital mobilization against long-term malinvestment?

### Why Are Bubbles Happening "More and More Frequently"?
- What changed in monetary policy over the 20th century to accelerate bubble frequency?
- How did abandoning the gold standard (1971 Nixon Shock) affect bubble dynamics?
- What role does financialization play in modern bubble formation?
- Is Bitcoin adoption itself subject to boom-bust cycles, or is it discovering its true value?

## Integration with 90-Minute Curriculum

### Fits into "Broader Implications" Segment (30 minutes)

**Position in Curriculum:** This book provides the macroeconomic and historical context for why Bitcoin's monetary policy matters. Should be introduced after participants understand Bitcoin basics but before diving deep into economic philosophy.

**Bridge from Previous Content:**
- **The Bitcoin Standard** established Austrian economics framework
- **The Price of Tomorrow** explained technology-driven deflation
- **Boom and Bust** provides historical evidence for why central banking creates destructive cycles

**Key Teaching Points (10 minutes each):**

1. **The Pattern Recognition Block (Minutes 31-40):**
   - Walk through 2-3 historical bubbles using Bubble Triangle
   - Highlight how "money and credit" was always present
   - Show the devastating consequences (1929 → Great Depression → WWII)

2. **The Bitcoin Alternative Block (Minutes 41-50):**
   - Contrast fiat's variable supply with Bitcoin's fixed supply
   - Explain how fixed supply prevents the "fuel" element of bubbles
   - Discuss what economic cycles might look like under Bitcoin standard

3. **The Personal Application Block (Minutes 51-60):**
   - How to recognize bubble conditions in today's markets
   - Why Bitcoin is insurance against monetary manipulation
   - Practical steps: track M2 money supply, Fed decisions, credit expansion

### Discussion Prompts for Facilitators:

**Opening Hook:** "Every major financial crisis in the past 300 years had one thing in common. Can you guess what it was?" [Answer: Abundant money and credit from central authority]

**Mid-Point Check:** "If you were an entrepreneur in 1845 during Railway Mania, how would you know if your railway project was genuinely profitable or just malinvestment fueled by cheap credit?"

**Closing Challenge:** "Name one way Bitcoin's fixed supply would have prevented or mitigated any of the bubbles we discussed today."

### Integration with Other Books:

- **The Bitcoin Standard (Saifedean Ammous):** Provides theoretical Austrian economics foundation for understanding why these bubbles occur
- **The Price of Tomorrow (Jeff Booth):** Explains why technology should create deflation, but monetary expansion creates inflation instead
- **Broken Money (Lyn Alden):** Offers technical explanation of how money printing works mechanically
- **Bitcoin Supercycle (Various):** Shows how Bitcoin adoption itself follows boom-bust patterns but trends toward fundamental value

---

## Connection to Other Books

### Deep Connection to The Bitcoin Standard (Saifedean Ammous)

**Shared Foundation - Austrian Business Cycle Theory:**
- Both books treat central bank credit expansion as the root cause of economic cycles
- Ammous provides the theoretical framework; Quinn & Turner provide 300 years of historical evidence
- Both conclude that sound money (gold historically, Bitcoin today) prevents destructive boom-bust cycles

**Complementary Strengths:**
- **Bitcoin Standard:** Explains why hard money works and fiat fails (theory)
- **Boom and Bust:** Shows what happens when you abandon hard money (history)
- **Together:** Provide intellectual ammunition for Bitcoin's monetary policy

**Discussion Integration:**
"If you've read The Bitcoin Standard, you know the theory of Austrian Business Cycle. Boom and Bust gives you the receipts - every major bubble in history proves Mises and Hayek were right."

### Links to The Price Of Tomorrow (Jeff Booth)

**Technology vs. Monetary Manipulation:**
- **Booth's Thesis:** Technology should create deflation (things get cheaper), but money printing creates inflation
- **Quinn & Turner's Evidence:** Every technological innovation (railways, bicycles, internet) was accompanied by monetary expansion that turned productivity gains into destructive bubbles
- **Synthesis:** Technology alone doesn't create bubbles - it's the intersection of innovation with abundant money and credit

**Specific Parallels:**
- **Railway Mania (1840s):** Revolutionary transport technology + monetary expansion = waste
- **Dot-com Bubble (1990s):** Revolutionary internet technology + Federal Reserve easy money = crash
- **Current AI Bubble (?):** Revolutionary artificial intelligence + unprecedented monetary expansion since 2020 = ?

**Discussion Integration:**
"Jeff Booth asks why we have inflation when technology should create deflation. Quinn & Turner show that central banks have been fighting technological deflation with monetary expansion for 300 years - and it always ends in tears."

### Complements Bitcoin Supercycle (Market Cycles)

**Bitcoin's Unique Position:**
- **Boom and Bust:** Documents how fiat assets are subject to central bank manipulation cycles
- **Bitcoin Supercycle:** Shows how Bitcoin adoption follows boom-bust patterns BUT trends toward fundamental value over time
- **Key Difference:** Bitcoin bubbles aren't caused by credit expansion (Bitcoin can't be printed), but by speculation and adoption waves

**The Narrative Arc:**
- **2011-2013 Bubble:** "Digital gold" discovery phase
- **2017 Bubble:** "Blockchain not Bitcoin" confusion phase
- **2021 Bubble:** Institutional adoption + Fed money printing phase
- **Next Cycle:** Sovereign adoption + fiat crisis phase?

**Discussion Integration:**
"Yes, Bitcoin has experienced bubbles. But notice what's different - there's no central bank expanding Bitcoin credit. Each cycle is adoption-driven, not manipulation-driven. The bust liquidates weak hands, but the floor keeps rising as more people understand what Bitcoin solves."

### Additional Cross-References

**Broken Money (Lyn Alden):**
- Alden explains the mechanics of how money breaks
- Quinn & Turner catalog the consequences when it does
- Both conclude Bitcoin fixes the structural problem

**The Fiat Standard (Saifedean Ammous):**
- Documents the political economy of fiat money
- Quinn & Turner provide the historical case studies
- Together: complete indictment of central banking

**Layered Money (Nik Bhatia):**
- Explains the hierarchy of money (base layer vs. credit layers)
- Quinn & Turner show what happens when credit layers collapse
- Bitcoin offers an alternative base layer that can't be inflated

2. **Intermediate:** "The Austrian Theory of the Trade Cycle" - compilation by Mises Institute (free PDF)
3. **Advanced:** "Prices and Production" by F.A. Hayek (Nobel Prize lecture)
4. **Applied:** Reread The Bitcoin Standard chapters 3-4 with ABCT framework in mind

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Time Preference:** Why interest rates matter for coordinating production across time
- **Roundabout Production:** How longer production chains require more capital and stable money

- Identify malinvestments in today's economy (zombie companies, unprofitable tech startups, etc.)
- Predict which sectors will face liquidation in next bust

### Compare Bitcoin's Supply Schedule to Fiat Expansion

**The Exercise:**
1. **Chart Bitcoin's Supply Curve:**
   - Current supply: ~19.7 million BTC (as of 2024)
   - Supply in 2028 (after next halving): ~19.95 million
   - Supply in 2140: 21 million (maximum)
   - Annual inflation rate today: ~1.7%, decreasing to ~0.8% in 2028

2. **Chart Fiat Money Supply (M2) Expansion:**
   - US M2 in 2000: ~$4.6 trillion
   - US M2 in 2020: ~$15.5 trillion
   - US M2 in 2024: ~$21 trillion
   - Average annual growth: ~5-7%

3. **Calculate the Divergence:**
   - In 2024: Bitcoin inflates at 1.7%, USD at ~5%
   - In 2028: Bitcoin inflates at 0.8%, USD at ~5%
   - In 2140: Bitcoin inflates at 0%, USD at ~5%
   - **Compounding Effect:** After 20 years, USD supply might 2.5x while Bitcoin supply approaches absolute cap

**Visualization Tools:**
- Create side-by-side charts using Excel or Google Sheets
- Plot both on logarithmic scale to show the divergence clearly
- Add vertical lines for major events (2008 crisis, 2020 COVID printing)

**Discussion Questions:**
- Which money is more predictable for long-term planning?
- How does Bitcoin's halving schedule affect mining economics?
- What happens to purchasing power of each currency over time?
- Why can't governments "just print Bitcoin" like they print fiat?

### Calculate How Inflation Affects Long-term Planning

**Retirement Planning Exercise:**

**Scenario 1: Fiat Savings**
- Current savings: $100,000
- Time horizon: 30 years until retirement
- Assumed inflation: 3% annually (conservative - actual may be higher)
- Calculation: $100,000 × (1.03)^30 = future purchasing power of ~$41,200 in today's dollars
- **Result:** You lose 58% of purchasing power just by holding "stable" dollars

**Scenario 2: Bitcoin Savings (Deflationary Assumption)**
- Current savings: 1 BTC
- Time horizon: 30 years until retirement
- Assumed Bitcoin adoption: Continues growing as store of value
- Assumed productivity gains: Global economy becomes 2% more efficient annually (technology deflation)
- Calculation: 1 BTC × (1.02)^30 = purchasing power of ~1.81 BTC-equivalent in today's terms
- **Result:** You gain ~81% purchasing power through both Bitcoin appreciation AND deflation

**Business Investment Exercise:**

**Question:** You want to build a factory that will take 5 years to complete and 20 years to pay back the investment.

**Under Fiat:**
- Year 0: Equipment costs $10 million
- Year 5: Inflation has raised costs to $11.6 million (assuming 3% annually)
- Year 25: Your revenue is in devalued dollars - is the project still profitable?
- **Problem:** You cannot accurately calculate if this is a good investment because the monetary unit keeps changing

**Under Bitcoin:**
- Year 0: Equipment costs 100 BTC
- Year 5: Equipment costs ~100 BTC (maybe less due to technological improvement)
- Year 25: Your revenue is in the same monetary unit you used for calculation
- **Solution:** Economic calculation is possible because the monetary unit is stable and predictable

**Debt Analysis Exercise:**

**Fiat Debt (Benefits Borrowers, Punishes Savers):**
- Borrow $500,000 for a house at 3% interest
- Assume 3% inflation over 30 years
- Real interest rate: ~0% (nominal rate - inflation rate)
- **Effect:** Inflation erodes the real value of your debt - you pay back with cheaper dollars
- **Distortion:** Encourages excessive borrowing and malinvestment

**Bitcoin Debt (Would Require Genuine Productivity):**
- Borrow 5 BTC for a business at 5% interest
- Assume 0% Bitcoin supply inflation + 2% deflation from productivity
- Real interest rate: ~7% (nominal rate - deflation rate)
- **Effect:** You must generate genuine productivity gains to pay back the loan
- **Discipline:** Only genuinely productive projects get funded

**Personal Action Item:**
- Calculate your own savings/retirement in both scenarios
- Determine what percentage of your savings should be in Bitcoin vs. fiat
- Consider: Do you want to be a saver (benefits from hard money) or borrower (benefits from inflation)?

### Bonus: Create Your Own Bubble Triangle Analysis

**Choose a Current Market:**
- Housing market in your city
- Stock market (S&P 500 or tech stocks)
- Private equity / venture capital
- Cryptocurrency altcoins
- Art/collectibles market

**Apply the Framework:**

1. **Marketability (Oxygen):**
   - How easy is it to buy/sell?
   - Are there fractional shares/tokens?
   - What percentage of assets are liquid?

2. **Money & Credit (Fuel):**
   - What are current interest rates?
   - How much margin debt / leverage exists?
   - Has money supply been expanding recently?

3. **Speculation (Heat):**
   - Are people buying for fundamentals or momentum?
   - Is there "greater fool" mentality?
   - Are insiders selling while retail is buying?

4. **The Spark:**
   - What technology or policy initiated the boom?
   - Is the narrative "this time is different"?

**Present Your Analysis:**
- Share with discussion group
- Debate: Is this a bubble, or fundamental value discovery?
- Predict: If it's a bubble, what will pop it?

- Key Quotes Review: 10 minutes
- Main Concepts: 15 minutes
- Discussion Questions: 40 minutes (5-7 minutes each)
- Action Items Review: 10 minutes
- Wrap-up: 10 minutes

### Discussion Facilitation Tips

**Encourage Debate:**
- The "useful bubbles" concept is controversial - let participants argue both sides
- Some may resist Austrian economics - welcome the challenge and use historical evidence from the book

**Use Current Events:**
- Reference recent bank failures (SVB, Signature Bank in 2023)
- Discuss current Fed policy and whether we're in a bubble now
- Compare US money printing to historical examples in the book

**Connect to Personal Experience:**
- Many participants may have lived through 2008 crisis or dot-com bubble
- Ask them to share their experiences and map them to Bubble Triangle framework

### Common Misconceptions to Address

**"Bitcoin is just another bubble"**
- Response: Bitcoin has had bubble-like price movements, but caused by adoption waves, not central bank credit expansion
- Key difference: Bitcoin supply is fixed - cannot be manipulated to create artificial boom

**"We need some inflation to encourage spending"**
- Response: Every bubble in the book had inflation and abundant money - it led to malinvestment and catastrophe
- Technological progress naturally creates deflation (things get better/cheaper) - this is good, not bad

**"Bubbles are just irrational exuberance"**
- Response: Book shows bubbles have structural causes (Bubble Triangle), not just psychological
- Remove abundant money and credit, and "irrational exuberance" cannot create economy-wide bubbles

**"Central banks learned their lesson and can prevent bubbles now"**
- Response: Book shows bubbles are increasing in frequency, not decreasing
- Since leaving gold standard (1971), bubbles have accelerated because there's no constraint on money printing

## Conclusion: Why This Book Matters for Bitcoin Adoption

**Boom and Bust** provides the historical evidence that Bitcoin's monetary policy isn't just a technical curiosity - it's the solution to a 300-year-old problem. Every financial crisis, every depression, every "unexpected" market crash described in this book had the same root cause: **monetary manipulation by central authorities**.

The Bubble Triangle framework gives us a diagnostic tool: if you see marketability + abundant money & credit + speculation, a bubble is forming. Under a Bitcoin standard, the "abundant money and credit" element cannot exist - Bitcoin's supply is fixed by mathematics, not manipulated by politicians.

For participants in book club discussions, this book should crystallize why Bitcoin matters beyond "number go up." It's not just an investment - it's an exit from a system that has repeatedly destroyed wealth, created depressions, and even triggered world wars (Great Depression → WWII).

The most powerful realization: **We're living through the biggest bubble in human history right now.** Global debt is at all-time highs, central banks have printed trillions since 2008, and the "money and credit" fuel for the bubble is more abundant than ever. The question isn't if the current system will bust - it's when, and whether you'll have an exit when it does.

Bitcoin is that exit. This book explains why.
