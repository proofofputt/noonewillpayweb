# Deploy Viral Referral System - Quick Start

## ⚡ 5-Minute Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Connect to your NeonDB database
# Option A: Using drizzle-kit
npm run db:push

# Option B: Run SQL manually in NeonDB console
# Copy and execute: drizzle/migrations/0005_add_referral_tracking.sql
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add viral referral system with proper scoring and share features"
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy
# Or manually trigger:
vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Test Referral Flow

1. **Take initial quiz**: Visit `https://noonewillpayweb.vercel.app/`
2. **Copy referral link**: After completion, click "📋 Copy Link"
3. **Test referral**: Open in incognito with `?ref=XXXX-XXXX` parameter
4. **Verify tracking**: Check database for `referred_by` field

### Step 4: Verify Database

```sql
-- Check that migration ran successfully
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'survey_responses'
  AND column_name IN ('referral_code', 'referred_by');

-- Should return:
--  referral_code | character varying
--  referred_by   | character varying

-- Test referral tracking
SELECT referral_code, referred_by, score, timestamp
FROM survey_responses
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

- [ ] Referral parameter captured from URL (`?ref=`)
- [ ] Scores calculated correctly (not just 100/200/300)
- [ ] Answer explanations displayed on results page
- [ ] "Copy Link" button copies to clipboard
- [ ] "Text to Friend" button opens SMS app

## 📊 Monitor These Metrics (First 24 Hours)

```sql
-- Total submissions
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_submissions FROM survey_responses;

-- Referral rate
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE referred_by IS NOT NULL) AS referrals,
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE referred_by IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(*), 1) AS referral_rate_pct
FROM survey_responses;

-- Average score
SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(score), 1) AS avg_score,
  MAX(score) AS max_score,
  MIN(score) AS min_score
FROM survey_responses;

-- Top referrers
SELECT
  r1.referral_code,
  r1.phone,
  COUNT(r2.id) AS total_referrals
FROM survey_responses r1
LEFT JOIN survey_responses r2 ON r2.referred_by = r1.referral_code
GROUP BY r1.referral_code, r1.phone
HAVING COUNT(r2.id) > 0
ORDER BY total_referrals DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration fails with "column already exists"

**Solution**: Column might already exist from prior attempt
```sql
-- Check if columns exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'survey_responses'
  AND column_name IN ('referral_code', 'referred_by');

-- If they exist but have wrong type, drop and recreate:
ALTER TABLE survey_responses DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS referral_code;
ALTER TABLE survey_responses DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS referred_by;
-- Then run migration again
```

### Issue: Referral code not showing on results page

**Check**:
1. API response includes `referralCode` field
2. Frontend state updates after submission: `setResults({ referralCode: ... })`
3. Browser console for JavaScript errors

### Issue: Scores still showing as 100/200/300 instead of proper points

**Check**:
1. `scoreQuestions()` function is being called in API route
2. Questions have `pointValue` field in `data/questions.json`
3. Response returns `totalScore` not just `score`

## 📈 Expected Results (First Week)

**Conservative Estimates**:
- 100 initial signups
- 40% referral rate → 40 come via referral
- 60% sharing rate → 60 copy their link
- K-factor ≈ 1.2 (modest viral growth)

**Optimistic Estimates**:
- 500 initial signups
- 60% referral rate → 300 come via referral
- 80% sharing rate → 400 copy their link
- K-factor ≈ 2.0 (strong viral growth)

**Action Items if K < 1**:
- Increase referral reward (50 → 100 points)
- Add social proof ("1,234 people took this quiz!")
- Improve copy-to-clipboard UX
- Add WhatsApp sharing button
