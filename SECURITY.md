## 🔐 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of **No One Will Pay** seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### ✅ DO

- **Report privately** via GitHub Security Advisories
- **Provide detailed information** about the vulnerability
- **Wait for confirmation** before public disclosure
- **Give us reasonable time** to address the issue

### ❌ DO NOT

- **Publicly disclose** the vulnerability before it's fixed
- **Exploit** the vulnerability beyond what's necessary to demonstrate it
- **Access** or modify user data without permission
- **Perform DoS attacks** or other disruptive testing

## 📧 How to Report

### Option 1: GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/proofofputt/noonewillpay/security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill in the details
4. Submit

### Option 2: Email

If you prefer email, send to: **[security@proofofputt.com]**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

## 🎯 Scope

### In Scope

Security issues in:

- ✅ Authentication system (JWT, bcrypt)
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ Database queries (SQL injection)
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Environment variable handling
- ✅ Dependency vulnerabilities

### Out of Scope

Issues that are NOT considered security vulnerabilities:

- ❌ Missing security headers (unless exploitable)
- ❌ Lack of rate limiting (already known)
- ❌ SSL/TLS issues (handled by Vercel)
- ❌ Social engineering
- ❌ Physical attacks
- ❌ Issues in third-party dependencies (report to them)

## 🏆 Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- **Acknowledgment** in our SECURITY.md (if desired)
- **Credit** in release notes
- **Gratitude** from our team!

We currently don't offer a bug bounty program, but we deeply value your contributions to keeping our platform secure.

## ⏱️ Response Timeline

We aim to:

- **Acknowledge** reports within 48 hours
- **Provide initial assessment** within 7 days
- **Fix critical issues** within 30 days
- **Fix other issues** within 90 days

Timeline may vary based on complexity and severity.

## 🚨 Severity Levels

### Critical

- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- SQL injection leading to data breach
- Exposure of private keys or secrets

**Response**: Immediate (24-48 hours)

### High

- XSS vulnerabilities
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- Unauthorized data access
- Privilege escalation

**Response**: 7-14 days

### Medium

- Information disclosure
- Missing authentication checks
- Insecure defaults

**Response**: 30 days

### Low

- Minor configuration issues
- Verbose error messages
- Missing security headers

**Response**: 90 days

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

- ✅ Use strong, unique passwords
- ✅ Enable 2FA when available
- ✅ Keep your browser updated
- ✅ Be cautious of phishing attempts
- ✅ Don't share your credentials
- ✅ Log out when using shared computers

### For Developers

- ✅ Never commit secrets to git
- ✅ Use environment variables
- ✅ Validate all user inputs
- ✅ Use parameterized queries
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Review security advisories
- ✅ Enable TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Use `httpOnly` cookies for auth tokens

## 🔍 Security Features

Our platform implements:

### Authentication
- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds)
- ✅ Secure cookie attributes (httpOnly, sameSite, secure)
- ✅ 7-day token expiration

### Data Protection
- ✅ SSL/TLS encryption (via Vercel)
- ✅ NeonDB connection encryption
- ✅ Environment variable isolation
- ✅ Drizzle ORM (prevents SQL injection)

### Input Validation
- ✅ Zod schema validation on all API endpoints
- ✅ Type checking with TypeScript
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Request body size limits

### Session Management
- ✅ Secure session tokens
- ✅ Token verification on protected routes
- ✅ Automatic token expiration
- ✅ No sensitive data in JWT payload

## 🚧 Known Security Limitations

We're working on:

- ⏳ Rate limiting (planned via Vercel KV)
- ⏳ CSRF protection (planned)
- ⏳ 2FA support (future)
- ⏳ Account lockout after failed attempts
- ⏳ Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- ⏳ Audit logging
